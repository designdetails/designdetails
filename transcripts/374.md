## 374: End of the Mac Era?

**Marshall:** Brian, it's a no meeting week for us. And, so most of my meetings have been canceled and the ones that have it, I've been going through and me being like a passive aggressive little, it feels so good.

**Brian:** I'm just straight denied, denied, denied. I just like send a message loud and clear to the organizer. I am ahead of you, delete these meetings. I demand it. Welcome to episode 374 of the Design Details podcast. I'm Brian Lovin.

**Marshall:** And I'm Marshall Bock. Welcome back for another episode! Brian, how you doing?

**Brian:** I'm great.

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** Busy Sunday. Let's do it. Let's do the thing.
We've got a great, great outline, so let's just jump in. We got to start by shouting out our new, very important pixels. Holy shit. Y'all came through this week. I don't know what happened. We have a long list today, so let's dive in. This is Brian's favorite part of the week.

**Marshall:** Brian butchers your name.

**Brian:** Brian fucks up the one thing that is most important to you. All right, here we go. A huge shout outs to Maxime Daraize, Jamie Rhodes, Vitaly Odemchuk a.k.a VO, Yuyang Luo, Yu Zhao, Jaynish Shah, Shanberg, Andy Santana, Erica Lester, Christopher, Mark Guill, and this last one, I spent a while Googling this, there is a letter, it's a Danish letter which is an O and an E combined. So I'm going to go with Jørgen Eidem?
shit. It's either yearn. I Googled a bunch of pronunciations and on YouTube and like those pronunciation websites, they had it different every time.
So Jørgen, Jørgen Eidem. Hopefully one of those is close, sorry.

**Marshall:** Well, you know, I love that we have Christopher, it just makes me think of that monster factory episode, put it in the show notes, where it's the pebble, it's like a version of the rock, but the pebble and his name is his like the announcement when he comes out is Christopher, Christopher, Christopher, Christopher. And it makes me laugh every time.

**Brian:** I'll find it. I'll find it. That's a great YouTube series by the way. That would be a good, cool thing. That's bonus cool thing in the intro. What's up?

**Marshall:** There you go. This is why you listen to the VIP section because you get to hear the cool stuff, but thanks to everybody. Wow. Big list today Brian.

**Brian:** Shit. Yeah. Thank you everybody. All right. With that, let's get into the good stuff. Here's the sidebar. Marshall, so last week we gave our first impressions of the new iPhones and in the subsequent days I acquired for myself a mini, it is officially a test device, so I'm not daily driving. But I went ahead and just did a full iCloud restore. So I have all my exact stuff. It's exact same configuration setting and all that kind of thing. And I've been walking around with it. I'll like take it when I walk my dog, you know, put it in my pocket and like kind of feel it out. Man, this is a great phone.

**Marshall:** I was saying, dude.

**Brian:** This is a really fucking good phone.
It's nostalgic a little bit. It feels so close to the 5 and the 5 was my all-time favorite. It feels so close to that. I just can't help, but like pick it up all the time and play around with it. I love how it feels. So I don't know. I still like the big one. And I feel like I've made a huge mistake because the mini's great.
I like the big one. I'm like, Oh wait, I wonder if the middle normal one is just the Goldilocks phone for me. And I have just been ignoring it for years at this point, but anyways, I'm going to hard consider a mini for my next daily driver. Probably the next cycle.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah, it's great. It's like you said, it's like a 5, but it's all screen except for the notch. But yeah, it's what I wanted. What I imagined when the 5 came out, I was like, what if it didn't have a forehead in the chin? Yup.

**Brian:** Oh man.

**Marshall:** That's what this is. Welcome to the future.

**Brian:** It's great. It's really nice.

**Marshall:** Well, I'm glad you enjoy it.

**Brian:** Yeah. Now I just need to get the middle one as a test device.

**Marshall:** Yeah, that's my next acquisition. I need to, I'll probably just pick one up in the store I think the order times are crazy on them.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. They're a little backlog. All right. Let's get into this week Sidebar. So Udie Chima hit us up on GitHub and asked us to give our first impressions of Auto Layout V3 in Figma.

**Marshall:** Yeah. We've been teasing the whole like, tune in for like the more design talk and stuff on the sidebar, but we haven't really followed through on it. So strap in this is about to get real deep. So here we go. Yeah. V3, here real quick, a cool thing is I got beta access to it. I was able to check it out like it's interesting to see where it is now versus where I saw it a couple months ago seeing on the inside of another company, working through iterations and just trying to find the sweet spot is cool.
Cause like, yeah, we all struggle with this. Yep, but yeah, it's out now and it's available for anybody to use. Just refresh your browser if you need to. And, what are your first thoughts, Brian, on this V3 Auto Layout?

**Brian:** so I feel like Figma is just in such a tough position where no matter what they do. Like things are getting better. A hundred percent. This update is huge. It's so much better. But the thing with this and the same thing happened with the original Auto Layout is as soon as it comes out, you're like, yes, this solves all my problems except for this one problem.
And so it's kind of like that, like it solved a bunch more problems, but it almost emphasizes the remaining things that I assume they'll continue working on and chipping away. So I would say I'm very happy. This solves so many fucking things, like an unbelievable number of gripes with Auto Layout that have made it frustrating to use.
I have avoided using Auto Layout for a long time because of problems that they have now solved, so it's good. I got to say their onboarding is fantastic as well. I think it's funny that they have to have such an intense onboarding for the feature because the feature is very complicated. But also the UI for the feature is really complicated.
Like it's not super intuitive. And we can talk about that here in a second. But yeah, I went through the whole tutorial. It's just a Figma file that you copy to your documents and you just scroll through and it's interactive. It's just a Figma file. And it's very well constructed. You know, they pointed things.
You'd be like, select this. Now, do this. Look how it changes. Isn't that? Cool. So it's a nice feedback loop of testing out all the different possibilities. So yeah, I'm excited. Problems are being solved. Design tools are getting better. You can actually make things that kind of behave like an app or a website would behave.
As the viewport size has changed as you add and remove text or icons from components. That's great. How about you? What do you think?

**Marshall:** Yeah. So you did the tutorial. I did not do the tutorial. It just jumped in head first. And, what's funny. Even when I did the beta testing is, they actually had instructions there and I didn't even bother to read them. And I was like asking them questions that were very clearly answered by the text right in front of my eyes, if I were just to read.
But. Yeah, box constant. As we've established, as that people don't fucking read myself included. So anyways, so when it went live, I just jumped in and it was like, okay, yeah, the whole idea of like, hug contents and fill container compared to what we had before, as far as like left and right stretching or, you know, alignment, is a really interesting change of mental model for this. And I think maybe that's one of the first things to say here is like, it's different.
If you, if you were fluent in V2 Auto Layout, you'll have to relearn some things for V3. Is that fair?

**Brian:** Yeah. I mean, they're going further into the nuances of Flexbox, but then they've also added just different ways to control children and parents behave slightly differently. So yeah, I would recommend doing the tutorial, obviously I think you could figure it out on your own after enough digging around, but this seems to be kind of the thread is there's just more flexibility at every level to fill, fit, resize, even having the ability to override individual padding on a specific child. It's huge. Like that was such a nightmare before. And you know, you'd have to make spacing frames. Like you have just a slew of frames that are like padding 12, padding 6, padding whatever.

**Marshall:** Hm, you know, I did the inverse and this is funny to talk about because now it doesn't matter. But, I did the inverse, which is I would have consistent spacing and padding, and then I would wrap things and, make the containers for those things. The wrapper's smaller than the thing it contained. So it would push off, you know, without clipping, you know what I mean?
and then either do like a left or right alignment thing. All of this is hacky as hell.

**Brian:** That's the point. Yeah. Like we don't have to hack anymore. All right. So let's talk a little bit about the details of it. I think, we can dig into the UI or in the actual feature here going to be kind of clicking around my windows. See my might hear me clicking. Tell me what do you think about this Marshall? I feel like the Auto Layout section is a very powerful section, but there's so much focus on making it very small, vertically in the properties sort of sidebar that they've had to resort to using iconography, to represent lots and lots of really complex ideas.
So like vertical versus horizontal flow, spacing between items, padding around items, and then there's like a dropdown and then there's a dropdown within the dropdown for pact or space between, then there's like four inputs and like a new way to pick alignment. Like the UI here is complicated and they've made it really, really dense.
And so it's hard to learn. It's hard to know what's going on here and this isn't maybe even a broader complaint about Figma's UI design. Does this bother you or do you feel like this is a pro tool? You get used to it, you learn at once and then you kind of just get the hang of it.

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is kind of where the debate has been, right. Or it's like, well, Figma was supposed to be usable for anybody. And now it's getting really complicated. And is this usable for an average person? Cause they just jump in and figure this out. Probably not. Yeah. So where's the line of this?
Is this a pro thing or is this a consumer thing? It's definitely more on the pro side, obviously. And you do have to learn stuff. It took me a while to remap that whole kind of road that you were talking about of different input types and drop down types with dropdowns inside of popovers and everything.
So, yeah, it's pretty complicated. And without exposing all that stuff, I don't know how you make it any simpler, right? Like,

**Brian:** But I guess that's what I'm saying. It's like, I think they've tried to make it too simple at the cost of clarity. There used to be a dropdown to pick between vertical or horizontal.

**Marshall:** I think that's fine. I think that makes sense. Like they didn't need, this is actually easier. It's one click, right. To switch between the two it's one click instead of two. So I actually appreciate that. That makes more sense. The iconography is pretty straightforward, like vertical and it isn't even like vertical and horizontal it's down into the right typically.
Right. So, I dunno, I actually, I guess it depends on the alignment and padding thing. That's where my kind of problems came in is like having to pop this thing out to change my, padding, if I want them to be asymmetrical, it's just as cumbersome as making asymmetrical corner radii. That sucks to have to pop out that little extra panel and then change each one of those where I could just like, why don't you just let me put semi-colons between them and type them out rather than have to pop this thing out and then like, click on this and then tab to the next one, then type in that thing.
I don't know if this is bothering you too?

**Brian:** I mean, this is just a problem I have with, a lot of the UI patterns here is like, click targets aren't always obvious, things that relate to other things aren't always obvious. Like for example, the padding around items is directly related to that pop over, that shows you the padding control and then the spacing, but they're two different elements and it's the same thing with corner radius and independent corners.
And then you have to open independent corners and then there's another like corner smoothing option below it. Like, there's just weird ways to get to things. And then related things just appear floating in white space. Additionally, you have to guess where you're able to click in the interface cause there's no.
Borders on anything. And my biggest gripe with this is like, imagine you're a new person and somebody says, go make something in image fill, how would you do that? Like you see a color swatch, you see a text input for a hex value. You see a percentage for opacity. You see a plus sign, like.
How would you change the fill style? like, if you click into the text field, it's not obvious that there's another click element. Oh, you click the swatch then within the swatch, there's this tiny, tiny little drop down tough header with us. Like impossible to see low contrast arrow.
Okay. We click into that and then we get into image fill. It's just like, things are not obvious where you click, what's a click target. There are things that look like it should be one click target, but it's two, it does multiple things. And, this stuff just adds up. It's like, it's just a million paper cuts.

**Marshall:** Yeah, to be fair. Like this is really hard. Like, you know, before

**Brian:** I'm not saying I could do this any better.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But like, so as a counterpoint, I think it's interesting to say in this particular example, they kind of do the right thing, right? Like by default the fill is solid, unless you're putting more than one fill on a thing.
In which case that second one, they make a transparent gradient by default, if I'm not mistaken. Right. Yeah. So like, that's probably what you would want to do. You wouldn't want to put a fully solid fill over another solid fill. So like, if you need a gradient. That's how you get to it pretty easily, or you can figure out like, Oh, this is what's different compared to my normal fill.
So this is kind of progressive unfolding of functionality as you start to use it. If that makes sense. So, yeah, I dunno. There's so much to pack in here. And like you said earlier, in order to pack all this stuff into that right side design panel, they have to be relatively short and concise.
Otherwise this thing becomes scrollable and so far to their obvious credit, like I don't have to scroll this thing very often. Do you?

**Brian:** No but I'm also on a tall monitor, but yeah,

**Marshall:** Me too. It's still like that's, I had to scroll like in Photoshop. I was constantly like having to pop out panels and having different keyboard shortcuts to make things larger or other things smaller. Like this is a really nice middle ground as middle grounds go, you know?

**Brian:** Okay. I'm really glad you mentioned Photoshop because Marshall last week I used Photoshop again for the first time in a long time. And I started on Photoshop as most people are in our generation did, like I made most of my first interfaces in Photoshop and Figma is a million times better. Photoshop is unbelievably confusing for exactly the reasons that you were mentioning.
Like there are panels that pop out and then there's panels within panels. And if you close one, it's not obvious how to get it back. And like speaking of confusing iconography, like Figma is at least much further ahead and trying to make things obvious. Photoshop is just a mishmash of colors meaning certain things and icons meaning certain things.
So, this is progress. And you know, we are nitpicking, but well here, let me say this. I would love to hear from a new person who's just getting started with Figma, what their experience is like, figuring out what things do. My hunches, it's just not obvious, but then I go back to my experience with Photoshop back in the day is you're motivated to learn and you figure it out and you Google for tutorials and you watch YouTube videos and then you figure it out and you learn it. And then you're good. And it's a pro tool it's kind of inherent that you're going to have a shit ton of stuff that you got to learn and figure out over time.
So I guess I just bounce between those two things feeling like it's complicated and there's stuff that's not obvious, but it's approachable. You learn once and then you go from there.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. I think, motivation to learn is a big part of this thing, regardless of how difficult the interface is. Yeah. In order to get better at it, you're going to want to learn not just how to use the interface, but how to get keyboard shortcuts to not even have to go over into that panel.
So you can just, instead of hitting that plus next to Auto Layout, I just Shift+A every time. Right?

**Brian:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

**Marshall:** So, maybe let's get into some details here. One thing that has bugged me about this, maybe a little bit of a nit to pick here is, the change in child alignment management.
So it's no longer managed by the child. It's managed by the parent and it's managed on the whole. It seems like all children obey the same rules. Is that fair to say?

**Brian:** In terms of like the space around or pact that option?

**Marshall:** Or like the, kind of the three. So you click on the box alignment and padding, pop over and then those kind of three lines where they align inside the box. Yeah, that thing.

**Brian:** It's such an interesting design decision, right? Like the three lines. It's weird, but it actually is kind of meaningful. Cause, it's representing so much that, you know, the children can be variable with. And then, as they align, they like behave in these certain ways. But you see the difference in the blue bars representing what's going to happen.
It's pretty good.

**Marshall:** It's very similar to the text alignment. Right? You have different size lines so that you can tell these are left center or right. Or justified, right? But this is an interesting thing, like why is this outside compared to the constraints that has that same preview already showing outside, like in the panel, like why is Auto Layout hide that behind a click?
Is it because it's infrequent? Like, and for the same reason, Oh, let me check. Can I do this? Can I do semi-colon, does that work? No, it doesn't. Oh, let me type in semi-colons or commas or whatever it happens to be, let me separate values. So I don't have to pop that thing open, you know?

**Brian:** Oh you can, you can do commas.

**Marshall:** Can you do commas or did they add that? It didn't used to be that way.

**Brian:** Yeah. 2, 3, 4, 5 with commas. That'll do.

**Marshall:** Oh God. Okay, man. I swear to God, I tried so many different variations. I think it was semi-colons in sketch. Right. But yeah, I tried commas as I tried all of them. Okay. Well, nevermind. Take all that back. Maybe I'll just cut that bit.

**Brian:** But see, that's the funny thing is you can't do comma separated values in the corner radius. It'll just revert it back to the thing, but then you can opt into individual corner radius. Like, so the shortcuts there are inconsistent.

**Marshall:** Oh yeah. Okay. So this is what I'm talking about. Yeah. Okay. So why isn't this the same?

**Brian:** Yeah, that seems like a bug, like the corner radius should support comma separated.

**Marshall:** All right. I stand behind by the original statement anyways, stuff like that bugs me. Cause like there's all this power there, but I have to click through stuff like anytime, like you can save me from having to click through things manually, please help me. But I do like that preview and similarly, I like the update to the constraints preview, showing you not only the top bottom left right and center, but kind of the hug contents or scale box thing they have in the center now.

**Brian:** Yeah, which is awesome. And they also made the click area. They added like a blue highlight. That's more obvious and a little bit bigger over the zones within. So it's easier to click on things like get something center center, so much easier now.

**Marshall:** The zones are easier to click. Yeah, for sure. How do you feel about that naming? hug contents and fill container? Does that make sense to you?

**Brian:** Yeah. So that's the thing is like, I feel like they were trying to find something more obvious than Flexbox because in Flexbox it's alignment and justification. And you have to know the access that flex is running along. So like if you have a flex row, alignment I think is on access and justification is off access.
And then it's the inverse. If you were have a flex column and it's a very confusing, like Flexbox is very hard to memorize that specific thing. And you always have to keep in mind the direction that you're flowing so I can see why they went with something that was different, which is space between, I think they say space around, which is kind of close to Flexbox.
So, they're like borrowing some they're kind of branching off on their own,
like pact means something else. So think hug contents and fixed. Sure. It seems a little more clear than, yeah,

**Marshall:** Okay. Cause there's also fill container. That's the big one, right? Like we've always had fixed and hugged contents, just under a different name, but fill containers, the real powerful one, right? Like that's the one that says always be as wide as you can. regardless of the, stuff inside of you.
And, I feel like before we had stretched left and right. But, if you removed something from a container, so say you had icon on the left, text label and an icon on the right. And that was like three 60 width, right? Before when you set that text field to be stretch left and right. So that it would always be as wide as it could be between those two icons.
If you hit the right icon, the entire container would get narrower, right? so you wouldn't have three 60 anymore. It would get narrower and you have to manually resize that. With this, you can hide the icon. If I'm not mistaken, you can hide that right side icon. And the text box will expand to fill the remaining space in that three 60, which is huge, right?
Like, it doesn't sound that big, but, the amount of, tedious resizing of stuff that you now no longer have to do or if you're building a design system, you don't have to depend on each designer to know all of the things you have to do to cope with the ways that these things move around. Right?
So this combined with Variants, I think is hugely powerful. We can talk about Variants and other time, but, I'm super stoked about that too.

**Brian:** Yeah, that's so interesting. Cause now it's like multi axis complexity, right? Like you can override the Auto Layout properties, the resizing and constraint properties. And then above that, if you're in a component there's Variants and Variants can have their own dropdowns and text inputs and all this kind of stuff, And then of course you have components switching. I mean it's a lot of flexibility and I think it's good if you can. Have a very well thought out system, but I think it also is probably right for a lot of people to make really bad systems that are going to be very hard to fix. So maybe we'll start to see some best practices emerge for like how these things all really interacted.
Like when do I make a different component versus a variant versus just override on an instance. I think there's lots of good questions there that. I'm not, maybe there's not a answer to, and it's up to your team to decide how they want to do it, but,

**Marshall:** Yeah, I'm worried about going through the way we've built things. Is in such a way that was kind of coping with how things were, and now that things are better, I'm going to have to undo some stuff and I'm worried it's gonna break things.

**Brian:** We have to redo everything.

**Marshall:** God.

**Brian:** We'll have to redo most things because of this change.

**Marshall:** How are you going to handle that? Like, what are you gonna do? Tell everybody, like, you're gonna do it side by side with the existing thing and say, this is deprecated using the new one. When you start a new thing, how are you, how you can do it.

**Brian:** I mean, it's just two of us on the mobile team, so we can just do, we can do whatever there's, there's

**Marshall:** Uh, you don't have dozens of designers getting mad at. You got right. Alright.

**Brian:** No, but I mean, I feel for like the broader GitHub design systems seem like, how are they going to handle this so that they don't break everybody's stuff, but simultaneously get people onto the new thing.
I don't know.

**Marshall:** Yeah. If you have thoughts, please let us know. I would love to hear them.

**Brian:** I mean, that's the thing is, what is Auto Layout before we're going to do that? Makes us have to redo this. and like it's all in the service of something better. Like if you redo it, your system is fantastic and it's so much better, but then the new thing comes out and it's really hard.
Like you've already done all the hacks to make the current thing work. And then the new thing fixes the hacks. You have to go back and undo the hacks, but that breaks the thing. It's like, shit

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is the exact conversation that has been, kind of triggered by this release it plus Variants. It's like, Oh yeah, we can rebuild everything to be better. Oh no, we have to rebuild everything to be better. And yeah, it's like, okay, do we always chase the new shiny? Or do we just sit on the stable thing for a while and then do a massive overhaul at some point in the future when things are even better than they are today?

**Brian:** I mean, I think the probably most correct answers to do it incrementally. I think. Redoing it all at once is just, it's too much of an effort and it's too hard to coordinate it and get the timing right. So you don't mess up somebody's workflow, you know, on a large enough team. I feel like going incrementally you know, like we're going to fix our headers.
We're going to fix our list items or, you know, very small pieces at a time and see how it feels. Make sure your, trade-offs between different components, component, variance, or child overrides, like figure out how you like to work and have those things, feel as you're designing a screen.
And then ideally you learn as you go one component of time, rather than doing every component versus some system that you think works in your head, but then in practice, it sucks. You have to redo it again.

**Marshall:** Yeah, that's kind of the approach that we've been taking is like, alright what are the components we have that have the fewest variants and are used the least frequently, like, Snack bars or something like that. That's like not super common. And there's only a couple of different styles of it.
Let's variant-ize that, see what that looks like. Oh, okay. Now let's move forward. Learning what we've learned from that experience. Yeah. This could be a whole thing. Actually, we should probably do a whole sidebar about Variants, but we're going real long on this one. Brian, it's been like a half hour.

**Brian:** Okay, let's move on. I would say TLDR Auto Layout V3. Very good. Despite all of our complaints. Very good. Thank you Figma. You are fixing things. It is great.

**Marshall:** We are complaining about small things, which is a good sign.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, that's the one thing you can always count on designers to do is complain

**Marshall:** Yeah, it's not broken. Like it actually, it works. It does all the things they said it would do. It's a little bit more confusing than we would like it to be maybe, but it's, it does all the things and doesn't break. That's all we can ask for really.

**Brian:** All right. Let's move on. If you didn't know we are listener supported podcast, which means that you listening to the show right now, you make the show possible.
And so far several hundred people have come together to make it possible for us to record every week to pay for our software or hardware, all of our subscriptions, hosting website, all this stuff adds up and listeners make it possible. If you've been enjoying the show and want to support us, we'd really appreciate it.
You can do that by going to patreon.com/designdetails for just a dollar a month, you can support us. And what that gets you is access to a new supporter only segment in every single episode called the Sidebar. Yeah, the sidebars like a, basically extra half of the show. So if you, if you really had to weigh it out, it's like, do I want to listen to whole episodes or half episodes?
And if you want whole episodes, every single week, that starts at just a dollar a month at patreon.com/designdetails. So thank you everyone this week who joined the fam, we appreciate you. And everyone else, If you hit the patreon.com/designdetails, you can get started today.
And here today's sidebar where we spent 30 minutes talking about Auto Layout V3 in Figma, among other Figma, little bits, and bytes. So if you want to hear a Figma chat again, that's patreon.com/designdetails. Okie, main topic time.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Okay. So main topic this week, we got a question from a new fam of the pod, Tamara, who we read off in our list last week of new VIP's.
She left a question on our GitHub repository asking. _At the risk of starting a Holy war. I was listening to the most recent sidebar. This is one from last week and episode 373. And where we talked about, the Apple M1 Silicon chips._ And, okay, so she says, _I heard Brian and Marshall complained about their computers. If I'm not mistaken, Marshall has a fan pointed at his laptop to prevent overheating and Brian struggles to keep the computer running with two displays connected._ And then she goes on to talk about how she started her career working in PCs and her husband, who's a mechanical engineers, still uses windows and hates Macs, because of the price, lack of flexibility and some design decisions. So in their household, they have this conversation pretty frequently are Macs worth it? Brian, I don't know, this is really a very interesting question.

**Brian:** Yeah, I love it. And we, I don't think we'll start a Holy war. Hopefully not, but yeah, I just right off the bat, when you hear us complaining about our computers, it's the same thing. Like in today's sidebar, we kind of spent a little time complaining about Figma, but we complain about the things that we love.
Like I think when it comes down to it, the Mac is still the best personal computer for the kind of work that designers do. But I do think that's lowly starting to change with tools like Figma that are platform browser based like the ecosystem for the tooling is getting better. But I just think it's really hard to ignore how good the Apple ecosystem is.
If you are bought into it completely.

**Marshall:** Can I tell a funny little story, Brian? Okay. So, I have a buddy from college and he's like hardcore PC guy, and he knows that I love Macs and Apple and I'm in the ecosystem, right. And so we were talking about gaming and he, I think he assumed that I was gaming on a Mac and he was ready to give me a ton of shit for gaming on a Mac.
And when I said, Oh, no, no, no, no, I'd never do that. I'd be game on PCF, a special PC built for gaming. He was like, Oh, Oh, okay. And I think there's this eagerness to kind of start a fight over like, what is faster, what is better. But I think maybe we're kind of both in the middle of like, yeah, I recognize where Macs are valuable and I recognize where PCs are valuable.
They don't do the same thing. And I wouldn't expect either to do everything.

**Brian:** I mean, I think it comes down to like, if you're doing anything, graphics intensive, you kind of have to be on a PC. And that includes gaming, like yeah, Mac can game, but once you actually game on a PC with a decent setup, you're like, Oh, this is what gaming is actually like on a computer instead of a console.
Got it. Like, it really is that big of a difference. I don't know where the M1 are, Like the M chips in the Macs are going to take all of this. Maybe in some future gaming is a real thing on a Mac. Even with the new chips, I don't think it's the case. Like you're still getting pretty shit frame rates at pretty low resolutions for not great games,

**Marshall:** It'll play like iPad games,  
That's fine. It's like a cheap console, right? It's basically like a switch, right. You know, which is no small thing.

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** Well, when it comes to hardware and kind of the ecosystem and stuff, have you seen MKBHD's most recent video? I think it's called it's time to recalibrate or something like that.
It's a really good video, man and the point he makes there is about how the fact that Apple makes everything from the hardware to the silicone, to the OS, to the software, you know, the actual applications running on it, like, they can build everything to work together nicely in a way that you can't really do with a PC.
Because of PC's mix and match nature. Like there's an inherent drop in efficiency. Cause it has to like kind of work with anything. You could have an NVIDIA graphics card with an AMD processor or an Intel processor you could do any sort of combination, you know,

**Brian:** Yeah, which is, I think part of the fun, but also part of the stress of building out a PC, like obviously you can build or buy a pre fabbed PC. And I'm sure a lot of people choose to do that. But I think a lot of people want to figure out because the PC is so customizable. It's like, all right, well, I can get exactly what I want.
But it is an intimidating world to dive into for that very reason you were actually researching. Like will this power system work for this combination of chips and GPU's and how will the cooling work? Cause this thing runs at this time, like you can really get into the weeds and it's complicated.
Again, this is for people who customize, you can obviously buy a prefab, but you never ask these things on a Mac. And in fact, it's even getting more and more that way, like on the new ones, I think even the RAM options like, there is only one or two now, 8 and 16 I think.

**Marshall:** It's on the chip, it's built in, you can't change it. It's like part of the system of chip. Yeah.

**Brian:** yeah. And like, maybe that will go away at some point too.
It's just like, Nope. It just works. Like you will never have to think about it. It will make a difference. Everything is just so fast.

**Marshall:** Right. And that's where we're getting to, I think is, it's not about chasing numbers of like how many gigabytes of this, or how many gigahertz of that? It's, it's more about like, does it go fast? Does it feel like it's slow or does it feel like it's fast? right? It's all about comparison to oneself. And the interesting thing here is like, because they make everything for itself. The numbers don't compare, right? Like, you know, they may have eight gigs of RAM, but it might feel like 32 gigs of RAM on a PC, right? Just cause everything works together so nicely and everything's on the same chip and blah, blah, blah, fewer trips to the bus or whatever, you know?

**Brian:** Yeah, which again, it just makes us so hard to cross compare between the platform. So you have to come back to the ecosystem, like what's the experience that you want when you turn on your computer? I don't know. Macs are far from perfect, but for the most part, if you had to say it pretty much works.
Like you get your AirPods, you get your phone, your iPad, like all this shit just talks to each other, in a way that a PC never will. That being said, you have to commend tools like Figma. Like it is really wonderful to be on your PC and be like, Oh, I wanted to check on this thing in a Figma file. And it just works.
Like it's a browser based technology and it's going to work on any device and. That is more accessible for people who are coming into design from people who don't have thousands of dollars to spend on a Mac. Like that is really cool to see. I think that's the most compelling reason, for people to continue investing in Figma is like, this is the best ecosystem we can build because it's inclusive of all designers, regardless of the type of computer they happen to own.
So, yeah, I could see this, this line blurring as we go forward. But that ecosystem, it's very good.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I can't say enough, like the magic of having an Apple watch and an iPhone and AirPods and an iPad, like an Apple TV with a MacBook Pro. Like that combination of things. Like everything just works nicely. When I want to listen to something, it knows if I want to listen to it on my phone, or if I want to listen to it on my computer and my headphones just do the right thing.
And, you know, and, and my watch is connected to my phone and all that stuff just works together so nicely. It's like, this perfect walled garden. Right. That's what they refer to it as like the walled garden, can't leave, but it's beautiful in here, you know?

**Brian:** Yeah, man. The watch thing is cool too. Like it's even getting more and more tightly integrated into the software. So, when the watch came out, you could use it to unlock your computer. So turn on your computer, checks the watches nearby it's unlocked on your wrist. Cool. It must be you. Your computer is now unlocked, but they've now pulled that specific functionality into tools like one password.
So now my one password, I can just double click the side button on my watch unlocked one password. I don't have to type my master password anymore. there's some really cool touches like that, that just keep evolving. Do you want to talk for a second about windows? because I think windows is this interesting wrench in the whole thing.
Like, as good as the cross-browser tools are, or cross-platform tools are browser based tools. I find windows is just not getting better at a fast enough rate. Like windows is continually a frustrating piece of software to use. What do you think?

**Marshall:** Yeah, I mean it's kind of clear to see the deeper you get into like customizing things, It's kind of like a V shaped, you know, duck flying formation. There's like these parts of the OS that always get the new updates, but then there's these ducks on the side, the trailing behind that kind of never get updated.
Right? So like, when you go into settings, the deeper you click, the older, the UI looks and it, like, they just never changed that shit. Right. And that's, that's something that doesn't happen on iOS or at least if it does, it's not more than like one generation behind. and usually all that stuff is built so that it all gets updated for free when they changed the OS level stuff.
So, yeah, that's always kind of bothered me as like, when you find these corners where you're like, Oh no one's swept here in a long time and it's pretty dirty. Like, do they just not care? And, it's probably likely that they don't care that much about that stuff. They made it once it still works.
Why fix it? You know, we got other stuff we gotta deal with. so I don't know, but that's kind of the difference that it's like the vibe between Mac and PC, it's like in Mac, I feel like it's this, a beautiful walled garden where every inch has been thought about and considered and designed with me in mind and PC it's like, you know, a really nice lobby, but when you go into kind of like the back areas, it's like, Oh yeah, no, you need to sleep in the corners.
And there's some cockroaches and like, but that lobby is really nice, I guess, you know, I don't know. That's a really weird metaphor, but, I think windows has started to look nicer. I dig the windows 10 UI style. I don't know how you feel about it, but the whole flat color thing I think is really nice.

**Brian:** I don't use it enough to have a super strong opinion. I mostly just pin things to the task bar and like launch from there.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Right. that's kind of how I use it too. I have like, you know, all of the, the game launches like steam and all that stuff, like down at the bottom. And I just click on those things. I almost never spend time, quote unquote, like on my PC, I'm in a game. My PC is the games I play for the most part.
Right.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. So maybe we're not the most representative windows users here.

**Marshall:** But interesting note, my cool thing. I'll go into detail on this a little bit more, but yeah, I plan to use the PC for a little bit more than that coming up, Brian.

**Brian:** well, okay, then let's wrap up this main topic. Do you think that the Apple era will be over and maybe we sort of bracket that with four designers?

**Marshall:** No, I don't think it at all.

**Brian:** I'm more bullish on the Apple era than ever before. Like I almost see it going the other way. The new MacBook Air being a thousand dollars and being really, really fucking good. Is starting to chip away at any reason that you would want to go to a PC, which is like, well, the PC is more power for less money.
It's like, well, now I can kind of get more power for less money. So I might as well be in the better ecosystem.

**Marshall:** Especially, that Mac mini for whatever, 700, $800 like that actually looks like the most powerful M1 Mac that's out right now. Like that's crazy. It's a crazy value. Yeah, I think it's just starting. I don't think the Mac era is ending. I think M1 is like the beginning of a new whole new era for Mac.

**Brian:** Yeah, except for gaming. I think gaming will forever be dominated by PCs just because you can get a GPU that's like 45 pounds and barely fits on your desk. And that thing is going to run the most insane games you can possibly imagine.

**Marshall:** Yeah. And until Apple builds their own console, that's capable of running x86 games. It's not going to, they're not going to get there ever, like yeah. Cause part of the problem with Mac gaming is that there's no, not no. There's very few games actually built for Mac, like all games work on PC, some of them work on Mac.
So yeah, I think until Apple actually makes a decision, says, okay, Apple TV is actually now our console and we're building it to be like, you know, a real gaming thing. And then now we have like an Apple TV pro that's like the, you know, the hardcore gaming one until that happens. I don't think Apple will have any, any foot in the gaming arena.
And it's just kind of a hobby. Anyhow.

**Brian:** All right. Let's do cool things before this gets too long.

**Marshall:** All right, let's go. You you can go first.

**Brian:** All right. So I got a tweet recommendation from Wayne, who's a designer at Microsoft speak of the Dickens. Wayne works on the outlook team, for iOS, I believe iOS and Android. I don't know. Anyways, Wayne's great, tweeted at me, this YouTube channel called Design Theory, which I feel like it's, M K what is it like? It's like Design Details, but for industrial design, which is cool because I watched the thing and I don't know enough to know if this person, I mean, the, I think the person is like an instructor of industrial design. So I assume they know their shit, but in the same way, I can imagine like somebody new to interface design.
Maybe being interested in design podcasts like ours, just to absorb the vocabulary, like hear how people talk about it and think about it. I felt the same way with this YouTube channel. So, the video that I watched that was cool was the PS5 industrial design analysis. it's just a different vocabulary, like it's words that I haven't thought to use or string together in a way to describe the way a physical product comes together and the way shapes mean things. And yeah, I mean, I've been struggling to articulate it. So for that reason, it's a cool thing. If you're interested in sort of branching out and learning a little more about, the industrial design side of things, I would recommend it.
I started with the PS5 video, but, there's only a handful of others. This person seems fairly new. It's only a few thousand subs, but quality is pretty good and the conversation is fun, I enjoyed absorbing it so.

**Marshall:** amen.
He's got like, 30 videos, something like that. Yeah, 31 videos and already 3,000 subscribers. That's pretty good ratio. but yeah, scrubbing through this video. actually really want to watch it now, but just scrubbing through and looking at the thumbnails, it looks like he's drawing over pictures.
So it was like, yeah, illustrating what he means, like the directionality of the lines and everything. Super cool. Love this. All right, new channel. I'll have to watch this, cool, Design Theory?

**Brian:** Yes, link in the show notes.

**Marshall:** Cool thing, Brian. Well, my cool thing is we've been doing so much talk about Macs and PCs, and I've been so effusive about my love for Apple and, and all things, Mac. I'm gonna talk about a PC for awhile.
So Brian, I just built a new PC. well, I didn't build it myself. I picked the parts and people who are good at building PCs will. Yeah, they'll build it for me. They'll put all those parts together, but I'm fucking stoked, dude. I've been waiting for a long time to build a PC. And all of these things have kind of come together at once.
So one, there's a holiday break coming up and I'll have a month where I don't have anything to do. So I guess I'm going to do and play some fucking games, dude. and, I have kind of an older PC. And I've been wanting to upgrade the video card and the processor, but it's like, there's always kind of been like there's new stuff coming out.
There's going to be new AMD processors coming out, they're gonna blow out it and tell all the water there's gonna be new Nvidia graphics cards coming out 3000 series. I was going to blow everything out of the water. Like just, just wait, wait, wait, wait. So I've been waiting now. They're out. So I finally pulled the trigger.
I built my dream PC. It is amazing. You want me to, you want me to rattle off some specs for you, Brian?

**Brian:** Say a bunch of letters and numbers. I will go mmhmm, mmhmm, mmhmm.

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is just lettering numbers soup, but, maybe it'll mean something to some people look it up. I spared no expense. This is definitely not a cheap gaming PC, but it's basically one of the best things you can build today with today's, stuff. So, okay, man, I've been so deep into the rabbit hole.
I know so much, and there's so much variance and like percentage differences between these things. But I think I got the best of everything. All right, here we go. So I got the new, Ryzen 9, the Zen 3 series, Ryzen 5950X processor. Traditionally AMD has been behind Intel on this stuff, but really stoked about that. So that's my brains. and then my graphics card is the. Republic of gamers that ROG Strix 3090 OC 24 gigabyte, Yeah, 3090 really stoked about that one. That was, there's a bunch of different, you know, NVIDIA released the 3090 spec and they have like the founder's edition, but all these different companies supe up and build different variants based on that, original spec.
And so you can buy different ones that have RGB or fans or water cooling or all sorts of different shit. But this one is like made to be overclocked has extra RAM on it. it's like, it's the beast. And it's made to be used with overclock CPU, which is why I bought that CPU, the Ryzen.
Okay. So those are the two main things. That's my brain and my eyeballs. So I'm putting that on a ROG Strix X570-E motherboard. I'm putting 32 gigabytes of 3600 DDR, four Ram into it.
That's four times eight gigs, RGB on that shit. There's RGB on all of this stuff. RGB means lights, colored lights. it's going to look like puke, but I'll turn it in and make it, make it really nice. By default, all these lights will be like, Rainbow cycling. So it's going to be interesting. but I put all of that into a Lin Li O-11 Dynamic XL case, which is a full-size case with the front side is tempered glass and the left side is tempered glass and they meet at this nice corner. So it's basically this open box, Florida ceiling, showing off all of the interior of the PC and the power supply is kind of hidden behind a wall in the back corner. Super cool. So I got a 360 millimeter radiator water cooler, for my CPU. That's got like three fans on it. I think I'll have like nine fans in this case, but yeah, RGB, everything. Oh, I even got a, I didn't write this down, but I got a M.2 NVMe one terabyte Seagate SSD.
I don't know if you know about M.2 that port compared to like a normal, 2.5 inch SSD. It's all flash memory, but I guess this is faster anyways. I'm so deep down the rabbit hole, Brian, lots of letters and numbers. Are you impressed yet?

**Brian:** Do you see how big my numbers are? Okay. So here's the thing, because the PC world is so fragmented. Every company is incentivized to make their things sound the coolest, so bigger numbers, Xs and all this shit. Like the Ryzen 9 Zen 3 5950X. This is the same shit as like LG TVs and monitors.
It's like just number letter soup. And I really appreciate about Apple that they're just like, nope, this is the is the A13, this is M1. This is the T2.

**Marshall:** Yeah. We still give them shit about their naming conventions, but they're still way better than basically everybody else. Buy a camera, buy a monitor, it's letter number salad.

**Brian:** Yeah, it's a mess. So you say all these things sounds pretty cool. There's some X's and Z's in there and everyone knows the X and Z are the coolest letters of the alphabet.

**Marshall:** Yeah, those are the fastest letters. Yeah. I mean, so I did so much research. I watched so many, mind-numbing YouTube reviews, just like talking about numbers and comparing cards and all this stuff. But learned from all of my research. I'll put the specs in the show notes, feel free to duplicate my setup.
I think it'll be a pretty good one for years to come.

**Brian:** Alrighty. Let's get out of here. This has been episode 700 and it's been episode 734 of the Design Details podcast. We've just completed a five-year time travel into the future. Welcome.

**Marshall:** Hold on, let me see if I can find it.

_Marshall plays Windows shutdown sound_

**Brian:** Nailed it.

**Marshall:** The 4K 144 Hz gaming, Brian.

**Brian:** I mean, as long as you play games on it, that demand this. If you get this and you're like, Oh, I'm going to play me some Stardew Valley. I'm going to slap you. But

**Marshall:** Minesweeper.

**Brian:** Minecraft. Yeah.

**Marshall:** Minesweeper, as going to say.

**Brian:** I mean, either Mine anyways,

**Marshall:** Do Minecraft, like with, ambient occlusion and ray-tracing and everything like Minecraft can be really demanding and beautiful if you set it up right.

**Brian:** Amazing. Amazing. All right. Well, I can't wait to see it in person. Tell me when it's built and I want to come watch you play some video games.

**Marshall:** You will see the lights from your house, don't worry.

**Brian:** Yeah. A red, green, and blue beam of light. We'll just stream up out of your house. All San Francisco will be like my God, that man has a PC.

**Marshall:** mmhmm.
