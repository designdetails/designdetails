## A Culture of Excellence

**Marshall:** All right. It seems to be working now.

**Brian:** Oh, if it's working,

**Marshall:** this is actually recording. That

**Brian:** I hope this doesn't get deleted.

**Marshall:** Oh, no.  Welcome to episode three seven. One of the design details podcast. I'm Brian
and Marshall block. Hey, dumb,

**Brian:** It's in the

**Marshall:** Yeah. EA sports it's in the game.

**Brian:** Dude that shit is classic. Like they just found the perfect dude with the perfect voice for the perfect series of video game. Like that is the stars aligning at a cosmic level. And anyways, props to EA for maybe the only good thing you've ever

**Marshall:** Yeah. True. True. How you doing Brian? Oh yeah. Uh, we'll come back for another episode, Brian, how you doing? That's it. Those are my words. I'm supposed to

**Brian:** yeah. Yeah. Uh, you know, Marshall, by the time this episode comes out, it will be Wednesday, November the fourth.

**Marshall:** just wake me up when it's over Brian. I can't.

**Brian:** I feel like we're recording in a time machine, kind of like. I think people will listen to this on November 4th and be like, how are they in such a good mood? Like,
don't they understand what is happening?
Cause I if we were to record and release this on Wednesday, I think our voices would have a slightly different, tone to that. that's how I'm doing.

**Marshall:** Yeah, let's not talk about it. A existential crisis. I need to escape, Brian, let's talk about design.

**Brian:** Let's do it. All right. Well, first up huge shout outs to float. Float is making this episode possible. Float is used by more than 3000 of the world's top design teams, including Buzzfeed and MetaLab to plan their projects and schedule their team's time. It's the most accurate tool for planning your project resources and scheduling your team's time.
And. In the age of remote working, you need that more than ever. You can learn more at float.com/design details. Thank you float.

**Marshall:** Thanks. Hello.

**Brian:** We also have some very important pixels this week. Um, I'm just going to say ahead of time, all of your names are beautiful. There are two names today. That are exceptional. Um, don't feel bad if, if your name isn't one of the exceptional ones, but my goodness, we got some good

**Marshall:** I just looked at the list, Brian. I know exactly what you're talking about. Are they related out? We'll find out. Go ahead.

**Brian:** I dunno. Okay, here we go. Huge shout outs to  Esteban Garcia, Ali Dashti, Maddie Pascoe, Danny thunder and Mordecai hammer. What the

**Marshall:** Yeah,

**Brian:** dude? All right. Danny thunder. Uh, I mean the, the mental image that immediately came to mind was Danny McBride in Tropic thunder.

**Marshall:** literally. That's exactly what I thought of too. My dude. Yeah. With the the burnt area. Yeah.

**Brian:** Yes. And then Mordecai hammer is like, it's like spinning up world of Warcraft and it's like random, random character named

**Marshall:** generator.

**Brian:** It w Mordecai hammer is in that list.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. For sure. But put them together. I just think Thor,

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Marshall:** thunder, Mordecai hammer together combined. They are Thor, the God of thunder with a hammer.

**Brian:** So. Uh, all are very important. Pixels supporters, um, are beautiful and special, but my goodness, what a name

**Marshall:** Some aren't blessed with the same names as others.

**Brian:** The name, Danny thumbed. Uh, thank you all for supporting the show and flooding us, talk about your names even though you had no control over them. All right. Uh, let's get into this week.
Sidebar Marshall. We had a question this week on get hub on our issues from Erin M one solid username. This is their first issue they have ever opened on get hub. They joined get hub this month. So. Um, I'm putting this on my

**Marshall:** Yeah, there you

**Brian:** get hub growth metrics. Plus one Erin M one says, I'm fairly new to the industry. I've taken my first job as the sole handler for the UX and UI design of an iOS app for small startup. Then there's a little more intro. My question is concerning adaptive design for different screen sizes. I've learned it's best practice to design for the smallest screen size to ensure the UI does not break.
However, my first feature was launched this week. Congratulations. And I was very disappointed to see how my designs appeared on my larger device. The iPhone XR, uh, 10 or sorry, the component goddammit.

**Marshall:** this is the problem, Brian.

**Brian:** Yeah. I hate it. The component scaled fine. The tech size, however, wasn't quite legible.
Do you have advice? You can land on how I can ensure my designs are consistent across all screen sizes. And how do you recommend conveying this to my development team? Mm. Mm, mm. Marshall.

**Marshall:** Uh, I think this is relatively easy. So I think you're going the right direction as far as like you should account for the smallest screen size. Like usually three 20 is as low as we go there. but yeah, if it's not working at three 20, you need to rethink it, But that doesn't mean you need to design everything at three 20. I designed it three 60 and plenty of people designed it three 75 for iPhones. A lot of times that's driven by whatever device you have on hand, so you can check it, you know, one-to-one pixels and actually hold it in your hand and see how it feels.
But at the same time, like when you're designing something, you should be able to know when, something that you're designing won't be responsive. Well, like if you should have a instinct for like, This will potentially wrap into multiple lines. And how do I handle that? And how does this button conflict with the text on the left, et cetera, like you should be thinking about these things.
And when you notice one of those potential breaks, mock it up in three 20 and see what it looks like. And if it's bad, then start thinking of rules to make it not be bad, or change your design so that it doesn't break.

**Brian:** I have a confession, Marshall,  everything you said is true. Uh, but I do not follow that advice. So I'm, uh, I'm a bad, bad designer.

**Marshall:** Task task, Brian.

**Brian:** But the point you said is true, which is a lot of times people will just design for the device that they have in hand, so they can check at one-to-one. And I happen to have the iPhone 11 pro max, which is the big 

**Marshall:** So four

**Brian:** And so I designed it for 14, 

**Marshall:** It's
big boy. 

**Brian:** This leads into your next point. Like, or even the point you just made, like still gut checking. How will this work? If the string is really long, what happens if these buttons get collapsed too tightly? Like still gut checking in certain instances? but yeah, I think having a mid point is probably the more pragmatic thing to be designing day to day on.

**Marshall:** Yep. That's how I do it. Just aim for the middle. And when you see something that might get dicey, when it's smaller, check it out, see if it is dicey. If it is maybe rethink your middle-size design. Also, I think just as important is. when things get blown up larger. So the thing I always think about is tablet, portrait, and tablet portrait almost always sucks unless you have like a list app or something like that, even then, unless it's like a main detail view, kind of a thing where you're splitting up the screen into two columns, it still looks really shitty usually.
which is why, you know, settings has that two column design plus inset and the right most column and, Yeah. When you, when you blow a phone screen up to portrait tablet, I'll almost always looks terrible. So I always try and think about breakpoints. Brian, how do you, how do you think about this?

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. Um, I mean, for me, it's like phone iPad, portrait, iPad landscape. Those are the three. Right. And then I guess you have like iPad multitask, which you can do like two thirds size, which basically is the landscape, uh, design. but yeah, break points makes sense.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I, I find that Usually my landscape tablet design more closely matches my desktop design or I, it gravitates in that direction, but portrait gravitates more towards phone portrait. Right. which is the constant problem of like trying to fill that space without everything looking like it's stretched to all hell.

**Brian:** Yeah. And I think that at least iOS has tools for that, like setting content, max wit kind of like you were saying, was setting so that, that content like lines of texts, don't go super long and become impossible to read.

**Marshall:** Yep.
So, okay. so I think we've established pretty well, like yeah. Designed for the middle, uh, account for if it might look weird, larger, if it might look weird, smaller, I would only do those on like hero screens, not for every single mock that you do.
Just like test your stuff, but, okay. So we've, we've established that stuff. How do you convey this to engineers? Well, I think, In the same way that I said thinking and break points, that's probably how engineering is thinking about it as well. They're, they're thinking about, different device sizes and the way that they consider those device sizes is by like, screen with, um, it's very similar to like media queries and CSS.
So, start thinking about where is the line like, Is it at four 14, like with Brian's big boy phone. Is that, is that as big as you get when you're doing portrait? yeah, where's that line. And I think there is some kind of standard sizes for that. I'll have to look up the numbers, but, Yeah. Usually it's something in the, in the realm of like small phone, big phone, small tablet, big tablet, desktop, and then big assets. Stop.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. Which is a lot. So yeah, you don't want to be doing that for every screen. So for me, it's like, since I don't want to be doing that on every screen you want to have. Rules and patterns, AKA your design system should basically solve a lot of this for you by default. And even the platforms today solve a lot of this for you by default.
So there's two things I want to point out. One is if you're confused about what tech size to use, just consult the HIG or the material spec for a pretty solid baseline. Like obviously you can deviate from that if you want. But those, platform specs have very sensible default that you just never really have to worry about.
And one of the reasons that you shouldn't worry too much about these things is that both platforms has what's called dynamic type, which means that the user can actually override any type decisions that you've made. So they could choose their text to be really, really big or really, really small. And so when you recognize that I find that you have to care a little bit less about the break points, because it's like, I could be on a bigger screen, but the type could be huge or it could be on a small screen and the type could be tiny. So like no matter any combination within that matrix of device size and type size, we just need to have more principled rules for how text, truncates or wraps.
Um, what happens if two elements, uh, need to reflow that kind of thing should be encapsulated in like a different. Layer of abstraction than just, you know, what size should it be at each break point?

**Marshall:** Yeah. And typically I don't change font sizes between breakpoints, unless it's a large jump, like from phone to desktop, but between small phone and large phone, that's all the same. And yeah, I would follow the HIG like 16, 17, whatever it happens to say for your standard size.

**Brian:** Yep. So anyways, uh, that's it for our notes. Hope this was helpful. Aaron , let us know, let us know if we missed anything. Um, or if you have any up questions for us and congratulations on shipping your, your first feature.

**Marshall:** yeah, congrats. And next time will be better. I guarantee it.

**Brian:** Yes. If you didn't know, this podcast is listener supported, which means that people like you or listening actually make the show possible. Uh, this happens on Patrion. We have a Patrion where people can go And starting at just a dollar month can actually contribute to the software that we're using and the work that it takes to create this every single week and in return, uh, when you subscribe to our patron, you get access to a new, special supporter.
Only segment of the podcast called the sidebar sidebars, like. Basically an extra half of the show usually will answer another listener question or we'll do an extra cool thing or something really designed specific. That'll really complete the episode. So for example, today, we answered a listener question about designing across multiple device sizes and, and thinking about typography across adaptive layouts. So if that's interesting and you want to hear a complete episodes of the show with the sidebar in the backlog and for all future episodes, consider going to patrion.com/design details and supporting us for just a dollar a month.
Your support means a lot and makes this show possible. Thank you to everyone who's supporting us already. And, uh, if you decide to support us this week, we appreciate you

**Marshall:** thanks everybody.

**Brian:** all right. Time to follow up. Marshall, you have

**Marshall:** Let us follow up. Okay. So last week we talked about the one hand myth. Brian, do people actually need to use the phones with one hand? We talked a lot about that. And, uh, one thing I failed to mention is, is a really interesting thing that happened at dub dub. And I know I've brought it up on the show before, but I wanted to mention it again, which is the move that Apple has made recently with iOS to change a lot of the, overflow actions.
Like when you tap on something, instead of it triggering a, an action sheet at the bottom, it triggers a menu. And only when they have. More judicious decisions that they want you to make. Like, are you going to delete this thing or are, you know, kind of like more of an, are you sure type of a question only then do they use an action sheet?
Otherwise they try and keep the thing closest to your hand as possible or the origination point of the tap as possible. So this made me think of, you know, this one hand thing of like, It's not just about being close to the bottom of the screen, it's about being close to where the original tap was.
And, so if you have a thing that's at the top of the screen and then a subsequent menu, putting that subsequent menu at the bottom of the screen sex, they're going to have to readjust their grip if, especially if they've already readjusted it to, to, to tap that thing at the top of the screen.
So wanted to bring that up. What do you think.

**Brian:** exactly. Yeah. I like this pattern a lot. it's not backwards compatible, so I think like a lot of those popovers are for iOS 14 and beyond. So you might have to have some, like put this in your spec, right? Like if iOS 14 do this, otherwise it's just the old action sheet. but in the future, I think this is going to be the default going forward.

**Marshall:** yep. I think it's a good rule, right? It applies to Fitz law or it adheres to fits law.

**Brian:** I liked the way you framed it. Like if it's an, are you sure question action sheets slash alert, otherwise pop over.

**Marshall:** Yep. Hit them where they are. Don't don't make me move. Uh, another thing I thought about while we were talking about this was, South paws, Brian, the left-handers among us. It's what? 8% of the 

**Brian:** what does that mean South

**Marshall:** Southpaw. Yeah. It's a baseball term for a left-handed pitcher. You never heard that before?
Yeah. Southpaw

**Brian:** so I'm a left. I'm a left-hander.

**Marshall:** Really? How did I not know this? I don't know.

**Brian:** I guess it didn't come up in, in our 5 million hours of conversation, I

**Marshall:** Yeah. And how did I never notice? 

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** are you ambidextrous at all?

**Brian:** Uh, yes. Not with everything, but with a cross skills, I switched. Yeah.

**Marshall:** Cause you use right-handed mouse, right?

**Brian:** Right-handed mouse, but I write with my left hand, uh, I use my phone with my left hand. I eat with my right hand, I throw with my right hand. So yeah,

**Marshall:** Hm. Okay. I probably should've known the use phone with left-hand that's the, that's the giveaway, but, okay, so this is interesting, right? Like, uh, have you used tick-tock Brian?

**Brian:** I have never opened tech talk

**Marshall:** Okay. Probably for the best, but if you had, you had noticed that on the player, they have these actions and the actions, instead of being like a toolbar along the bottom there over the video, aligned with the right side of the video, I think a bite did something similar to this and like, this is kind of common pattern now, but, It's really great for right-hander real close to your right thumb.
Uh, you got to reach all the way across the screen though. If you're a left-hander, I'm not even sure if they allow you to flip it back and forth, but that's something to consider too. If you're favoring one side of the screen, think about, uh, the people who have to reach all the way across the screen and tap

**Brian:** add an option. Add a setting preference.

**Marshall:** Yep. Yeah. If you're, and I wouldn't say that for everything. Like if you're. If you just have actions across the bottom of the screen, I wouldn't think of adding another setting, but if you really heavily favor one side of the screen or the other, maybe consider putting a setting in there, 

**Brian:** all right, so I have a tiny bit of followup. So, uh, Geetha Carta, Holly. I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly. Is just on fire, editing our transcripts. So we put up the transcript for three 70 last week. Uh, she edited three 69 and did another huge, poll request to three 70. So thank you again.
If people don't know we've started putting transcripts up there on our get hub repo, we'll have a link in the show notes. Uh, they're very rough. We are just copying and pasting them out of our editing tool to script. And so there. Far from perfect. And a lot of folks have volunteered to, to help keep an eye on that and keep those following through.
So thank you. Uh, we'll keep the transcripts coming, but yeah, they're a little rough if we don't give them at least a pass or two. 

**Marshall:** Yeah, until Geetha touches them. In which case that they look much better, but yeah, it comes straight out of the script. A little, little rough around the edges,

**Brian:** All right. Uh, that's, it for follow up.

**Marshall:** got some tweets.

**Brian:** yeah. W so we had one tweet and, related to our last episode, talking about bottom oriented, single hand use apps, uh, Connolly Raider says one of my favorite summable interfaces is pocket casts, customizable action bar. At the bottom of the player, it allows the user to prioritize features and keeps them reachable.
I mean, I just love pocket cast in general. And this is, another reason. Yeah, you can customize the actions along the bottom when you're listening to a show. So whatever you need, wherever you need it, uh, they give you that control.

**Marshall:** not a sponsor by the way, but,

**Brian:** Not a sponsor should be given how many times we've shouted

**Marshall:** given how much business. Yeah. Uh, well, this also reminds me of a tweet bot. If you've ever used tweet bot the fourth and fifth tabs on the bottom are. Changeable. So when you long press on them, it pops up a little menu. You can choose which of like four or five different tabs can appear there.
Love that, love that stuff.

**Brian:** Love it. Okay. This week's main topic, a listener question from Andrew C a K a the challenge on get hub. Chance the rapper asks all right, this is a little bit of a long one. Uh, we will selectively paraphrase.
Here we go. I need some advice. The work we are handing off is being implemented in a sloppy way with not a lot of design, empathy, or consideration of experience by the developers working on the product. The handoff process has become more detailed as we try to not lose the fidelity of the feature we've designed, but often certain decisions are made on the dev side where a choice is quote unquote, good enough and fails to adhere to the requirements of design.
this results in a subpar experience when we defend ourselves mentioning the implementation is not as designed. We get called out for either not caring enough or not being more on top of, developers to work closer on the handoff. I don't know if it's relevant, but we don't have a design leader manager slash stakeholder higher up at the company where two product designers, we report to the director of product.
And I've noticed that not having a more senior voice that speaks our language means our recommendations and criticisms of the process have fallen on deaf ears. What steps can we take to make sure that not only is the work done properly after handoff, but try to establish a more widespread culture about caring about the work that everyone is doing.
Ah, Ah, man, I felt, I felt the frustration just squeezing through the pixels on my screen coming out of, Andrew's message 

**Marshall:** Bathed intention.

**Brian:** Yeah. So, Marshall, how do you get engineers to give shit is how I would kind of sum that
up.

**Marshall:** boy. well, first off, this is not unique to your situation or your company or anything. This is just kind of how enj works in my experience. It's like they have a lot of stuff. So thinking about that is more than just design and it's real easy for them to go. Yay. Yeah, whatever it doesn't break. It doesn't crash.
It's good enough. Also, they, they have their time mapped out and planned out a lot more granularly than we do as designers typically. So I know how long they have to do this thing because there are a thousand other things breathing down the back of their neck waiting to be done as well. so yeah, wanting to just do something that's good enough and move on to the next thing is not unique to your company.
This is kind of just how inj functions in my, experience, Brian, how do you feel.

**Brian:** Yeah, I mean, I've encountered this at times and it makes you appreciate engineers who give a shit whole lot more when you encounter them and get to work with them.  I took some notes I can go through and I guess maybe just stop me if you want to jump in and add something. Uh, the first is getting involved early and often, which it sounds like is already happening in this scenario, but that would be the first thing is like Watson, lots of communication.
if things are getting dropped, point them out early, I think the most annoying thing that I've encountered for engineers is when you're at the finish line and you say, Oh, but this thing isn't quite aligned. Right. And they're like, Yeah, but we're shipping tomorrow and too little too late. So if you have that process of, critique and review happening early happening, often it at least gives you more face time to try and catch more things before they ship.
The second thing that came to mind, you wrote quote, not having a more senior voice that speaks our language. And the thing that jumped out to me about this is this puts the onus on the engineers to speak, the language of design. And I think that's a little bit unfair because as Marshall was saying, engineers already have a ton of shit that they're dealing with.
There's a lot else, uh, that they have to think about outside of the design. And so, in my opinion, it's actually our job as designers to make the language of design really clear approachable internalizable for engineers and you know how to do that. I'm not totally sure. I, I suppose like one useful exercise might be.
To sit down with your engineers and ask them what they think is good software. Like, tell me about the apps that you really like. Why do you like them force them to, to really think about what it is about software that makes it good versus what makes it bad and then take those good things. And that's some, why is this good?
Oh, well, I liked that it was easy to read or, or the buttons were all really clear or the, those were in the right place. I don't know, like having people arrive at the conclusion. Of of design being impactful on the end user experience or, or the way you feel about a piece of software, if they can come to that conclusion on their own, it seems more likely that they'll internalize that.
And remember it when they're off on their own implementing your mock.

**Marshall:** Yeah. It's a lot easier to make the why stick than the what. If you get people invested in the why the, what comes easy.

**Brian:** Uh, the next thing I put down is to make compromises strategically. And you know, we we've talked about this a lot on the show. It's just
like

**Marshall:** Compromise as a currency.

**Brian:** compromise is a currency and you're out where you want to plant your flag. Is it on getting the corner radius of something completely, right? Or is it on getting. The layout and vertical rhythm and type hierarchy. Perfect. Like one of these is clearly more important than the others, and you should treat your reviews and your, Gates before shipping accordingly.
Like if something is more important, treat it as such and the less important stuff, you know, either it's small enough that you should go in and fix it, like figure out how to get into the code base, or it's just not important enough to make a big deal about and. in an ideal world, you get all of this stuff, but it sounds like you don't have that world.
So make your compromises a strategic part of your work. give things up that you don't care about so that when you have a big thing that you really feel is important, the engineers will recognize that you've already given up a lot of ground and they'll want to reciprocate that.

**Marshall:** Oh, yeah. 

**Brian:** I guess, Marshall, and I'm curious your, your point of view on this one, Because Andrew was saying that there's not a person like a design leadership position at their company. And honestly I've found that to be really valuable, to have somebody at the table in leadership at the company who everybody just respects. Um, I mean, that's a game changer and having a person like that buys a lot of Goodwill for design and.
can win a lot of arguments. I dunno. What, what would you do if you didn't have that, or do you have experience without having a design leader in your company?

**Marshall:** no, I don't. But if I were to think about what I would do, if I were in that position, it's like, when there's a void of representation, you can step into that, right? Like you were saying earlier that the onus is kind of on you as the designer to, to speak that language and, to share the why of how things are going.
Or at least to make sure that that communication is happening as far as like actually having a seat at the table. And I think, one of the most important things you can have for design excellence is the ability to stop something from shipping when it's not good enough. And if you don't have that, No amount of leadership or a lack of leadership is going to make a difference. It's like, you need to be able to pull the brakes, when something doesn't meet the bar, rather than just getting yelled at and going like this time. Wasn't good enough. Next time don't suck so bad. Right. 

**Brian:** uh, w one of my colleagues recently shared, I think it's called stopping the line. And it was a thing at Toyota. I believe. Where anybody on the, the assembly line could pull a switch that would stop the entire process. And if they identified a defect, they could force everyone to address that before they shipped a bunch of shitty things.

**Marshall:** That's how it should be. Yeah. But if you don't have that bit to flip, if you don't have the power to say no, then. Yeah, you're kind of destined to continue shipping whatever, and ends up building. so yeah, I mean, that would be like, regardless of whether you have a voice in leadership or not just the ability to say, don't think this is good enough and this doesn't meet our bar before anyone else can say, Hey, wait a minute that didn't meet our bar.
What are y'all doing over there?

**Brian:** I, I think this gets to, I mean, you mentioned like how do you have excellence in, the quality of your work? And I guess this kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier about, helping the people on your team. Come to the realization that good design is important and results in high quality software.
but that's how do you instill a very aspirational mindset the heads of your colleagues that we're here to do the best work possible? In other words, how do you build a culture of excellence where people show up to do the best work they can possibly do? And we only ship it when we're, we're proud to show it to the world and stand behind every pixel and every decision and look, processes or processes.
You're going to have to ship things that you're not always super proud of and you'll have to fix in a follow-up patch, but it's, it's really the principle of it. The aspiration of it that, if a culture. Truly embraces that and is all aligned that, Hey, we're here to ship excellent software and nothing else.
I mean, that's like a super power, that gives everyone the permission to stop the line, everyone, the permission to say this isn't good enough. And I don't know this is aspirin and it's hard to, build that into a team, but. Hey, it's I think it's worth starting to try and, and having conversations with engineers and trying to get them want to do the best work possible, which means, you know, we're gonna care about the details.

**Marshall:** Yeah. And, and like I said earlier, getting them invested in why you've chosen those details to be the way they are, rather than just giving them a list of ingredients to add together in some order and hope that the recipe comes out. Okay. Like if they understand why you're putting in this much and stirring it for this amount and heating it at this temperature, like to stretch the metaphor like that will make more sense to them.
And they won't just be following instructions still actually be. Cooking  a metaphor is Brian.

**Brian:** The metaphors are good. 

**Marshall:** Well, hopefully that answered your question.

**Brian:** Yeah. Hard things are hard. Keep pushing. Don't give up. don't admit to feet. These things are improvable. They're fixable. And it will feel immensely satisfying to have sort of turn the tide of, of a culture that doesn't care about this kind of stuff into one, one that really does.
All right. Uh, cool things and wrap up. Shall we?

**Marshall:** let us, I will go first on the cool things this time, Brian.  Uh, my cool thing this week is neither a music thing nor a YouTube thing, Brian, for fucking once I have a real world thing to recommend to people

**Brian:** Wait, wait, wait, hold on. I

**Marshall:** space. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Uh, okay. So I like many of those in our audience am sitting in a chair most of the time, like, 18 hours a day or so it seems like lately.
And, uh, I don't know about y'all, but I don't have the best posture in general. So, My partner got for me a posture corrector. we'll have a link in the show notes to the specific one that I got, but I don't think it really matters. The one that I have is pretty good. So it's a 15 bucks or whatever, but basically it's like, um, you know, Brian and the old, like a new our films, you know how like that.
Private investigator has like a, that like gun strap that goes over his shoulders. Like the holster thing, like a Brown leather thing, uh, connects across the back. It basically, it looks like that just without the gun holster part. Um,
so like of. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. but yeah, it's like kind of stretchy, spandexy soft, cushy material with these, Velcro straps that you can adjust to the tightness that you want.
And it basically uses that connection across your back to pull your shoulders backwards, which keeps your posture in good shape. And then if you have a decent chair with lumbar support, your, your back's in good shape. So, Yeah, I, this has been helping me. My back has felt really nice. not that it felt terrible before it, but I, I haven't worried now.
And I noticed that my posture is actually even better when I'm not wearing the thing. So

**Brian:** do you have to wear it over your clothes? Like everyone notice it.

**Marshall:** Uh, I, yeah, I'm wearing it over my shirt and it definitely bunches shit up in a weird way that I'm constantly pulling my sleeves and the back of my shirt down. But aside from that, it's pretty bulky. I'm not sure that I would wear it under like a t-shirt, but maybe under like a hoodie wouldn't notice.

**Brian:** Okay, Sandy something. Okay.
Look at this Amazon review.

**Marshall:**  fuck?

**Brian:** there is a very great Amazon review. Uh, I'll I'll say is go to the Amazon link in the show notes, scroll down to the reviews and you will see a picture of a fellow wearing the posture corrector, uh, in a place that is not supposed to go. Uh, great review. Great

**Marshall:** yeah. Uh, Hey, can't go wrong. This guy says it's good. Must be.

**Brian:** It must be good. Yeah. Um, I will also add before we started recording Marshall looked at this and it was sold out until November 4th and it's now, uh, 40 minutes later and I refresh and it's now out of stock until November 
6th. So maybe by the time this airs it'll be like December

**Marshall:** Yeah. This is a very specific one, but basically it's just, you know, some fucking straps that keep your shoulders back. Like, you know, there's a bunch of different options. Don't don't have to choose this one. It does have an American flag on a brand.
So that must mean it's good.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. 

**Marshall:** All right. What's your cool thing, Brian.

**Brian:** Uh, Michael thing. I can't believe I didn't do this. I guess it's been out a couple of weeks now, and that has halide Mark to the camera application, that everyone should be using to take photos if you're on a, if you're using an iPhone,

**Marshall:** yeah. Mentioned halide last episode, even, right.

**Brian:** Yeah, I think we mentioned it when we were talking about like great bottom oriented summable UIs, uh, halide. Does a great job. And so, yeah, I'll make that my cool thing this week. The app is great. The camera's great. so many good tools, like it really unlocks a lot of the, power of your camera.
Like it's actually pretty amazing how much power is there, but untapped until you get into apps like this, that really get deep into the API APIs and, and bring some functionality to the surface that gives you control over how your images are going to look. so let's just get that out of the way. App is fantastic.
Go download it. Uh, it's a paid app, just do it. It's independent software by a team of three. Everyone should support indie software and just buy this. But on that note, this is a team of three. I want people to remember that like the quality of this is so fucking good. And if you go to their website, even halide.cam, like.
Everything from their marketing to the app itself is just buttoned up. It is crisp. It has its own voice. I mean, this is like inspirational stuff for me, so I recommend people get the app, but also take time to poke around, The supplemental content here just admire some of the design that Sebastian to with and in that crew is doing so how I'd Mark too.
It's out

**Marshall:** I think they may be the only application and the app store is still using the page flip animation and I'm here for it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I dig it. 

**Brian:** Alrighty, let's wrap.
