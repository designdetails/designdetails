## 370: Designing for One Hand

**Marshall:** man. I gotta say, not having a haircut for this long. Here, let me describe kind of where I'm at: you know, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire? You know that one where he had like grown his hair out kind of long?

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** I'm right around there right now.

**Brian:** Okay. What's the next phase?

**Marshall:** Well, I don't know.

He cuts it off shorter in the next movie. So I guess, I guess I have to get a haircut soon.

**Brian:** Yeah. Well, just keep an eye out for Cedric. Okay.

**Marshall:** _Laughs_

**Brian:** Well, well, welcome to episode 370 of the Design Details podcast. I'm Brian Lovin.

**Marshall:** and I'm Marshall Bock. Welcome back for another episode. Brian, how are you doing?

**Brian:** I'm doing just great. Things are fine.

**Marshall:** Convincing.

**Brian:** You know what I'll say? I'll say I've had a few weeks of not feeling super great RE: productivity and this week was better.

**Marshall:** Okay.

**Brian:** And I feel like I got some stuff done this week and that is a good feeling. I like ending days feeling as though I made progress in my life.
And that doesn't happen every day. Some days it's just like, I think I kind of was doing busy work or something like that. And so transitioning from several days like that in road to something that feels _you go to bed and you're like, yes! I did good work today_. That's a good feeling. So that's how I'm doing.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I love the thing of when you have a thing that you really need to do and you can forget about it every once in a while. But every once in a while you'll be like, ah I gotta do the thing, What's the thing? Oh yeah it's that fucking thing. I gotta do that thing. But then after you've done that thing, you still get that little pang of like, _I have a thing I got to do_, but then you remember like, Oh yeah, it's that thing.

And I did that thing already. Yeah. I don't have to do it anymore.

**Brian:** yes, I already did it. Check. Yeah. That's a good feeling. Anyways, how are you doing?

**Marshall:** Doing good man. Doing good. Looking forward to this episode, we've got some fun stuff to talk about.

**Brian:** We have a very, very full outline, I will say. So we should just dig in huge shout out right off the bat to CuriosityStream. We're going to teach you a lot of stuff here in this podcast, but CuriosityStream is going to teach about all the other stuff like literally every other topic CuriosityStream has you covered.

It's an on-demand documentary streaming service where you can learn something new from thousands of award winning documentaries, you can get started for just $14 and 99 cents for an entire year of streaming at curiositystream.com/design.

**Marshall:** Nice.

**Brian:** Thank you, CuriosityStream!

Huge shout out this week to Float as well. Oh Marshall, every week it seems like another big company is announcing full-time remote status and the trend shall continue. And Float is a lifeline for teams that work remotely, helps you keep your team in the know on where, and when you're working from it is a resource planner for remote working companies.

You can learn more at float.com/designdetails. Thanks so much to Float!

**Marshall:** Thanks Float.

**Brian:** All right. We have some VIP's this week. Interestingly Marshall, we aren't doing a lot of like acquisition tracking here on the podcast. We don't have a lot of tracking pixels floating around.

But it is interesting to see when there's like a little micro spikes of people who join our Patreon.

And so last week, the call to action was: do you want to hear us talk about the Apple event and like share our opinions? Maybe a few people did, it's hard to say. Anyways... _laughs_

**Marshall:** Well, I think I would be one of those people who'd be like, ah, I'm kind of interested in what they have to say. Right. Especially because we talk about things from a design angle, rather than just recapping the same thing that _The Verge_ has already said, or whoever.

**Brian:** I hope so. Yeah. I think we did a little bit of recap, but hopefully like the design parts jumped out and we ended up talking about that kind of stuff. And that's the more interesting part. Anyways, a huge shout out to our new VIPs, very important pixels. Shout out to oof.. this could go either way.
Andrea or Andrea Molnar, Aaron Burkhart, Dominic Holmes, Altay Aydemir, Austin Schafer, Pfutz that's P F U T Z. How would you say that? Futz,

**Marshall:** Futz. Probably. Yeah, it's goof though. I like it.

**Brian:** Pfutz and Mable Wong. Wow, everyone. Futz.

Yeah. Well, thank you all for supporting the show. Really appreciate it.

**Marshall:** Yes. Thanks everybody.

**Brian:** Okay. Sidebar time.

**Marshall:** Let's get into the sidebar. Yeah, we got a little bit of follow-up.

**Brian:** Sidebar follow up.

**Marshall:** Yeah. It's meta. It's like follow up inside of the thing. We got other follow-up for main topic.

**Brian:** We will have, this is going to be part one of two follow-up sections.

**Marshall:** So the intra sidebar follow-up is, let's talk about MagSafe a little bit. So Marques Brownlee, MKBHD on the YouTubes. He came out with an episode recently of unboxing. And showing off the MagSafe charger. And one of the questions we had was, the strength of that charger. And if you're interested in seeing how strong or actually how weak it is, check out that video.

So link in the show notes for that thing. But while they're talking about MagSafe, one thing I forgot to bring up is a thing that we lost when we lost MagSafe from the MacBook was that, in addition to the safety of not worrying about having your laptop ripped across the room, because he stepped on the cord.
we also had that nice little light that was amber when your computer wasn't fully charged and green, when it was fully charged. So you didn't have to open it up and look at the screen to see what the battery level was. You could just see it right there at a glance. also it's nice to see I don't know if you ever did this, but like, with coworkers in a conference room sharing chargers, like you could look around and be like, _Hey, you're green, do you mind if I get your charger real quick?_ right! so I mean it's a small use case, but it's something I really miss and I wish they would have at least included in the USB-C plug, or something to that effect. Like I dunno.. Do you, do you miss that light, Brian?

**Brian:** Yes, I miss status lights. What was the one? It was built into the side of the MacBook and remember like the holes that they drilled in the aluminum were fucking microscopics that the light could go through.

**Marshall:** yeah.. yeah.. yeah..

**Brian:** And I remember it was some interview with the designer talking about how they timed the pulse of the light to be like the average human's breath at rest.
So that when you watched it pulse on and off, it was like a little meditative breathing. Yeah. Which is cool. And I miss those kinds of status lights.

**Marshall:** yeah, That's crazy. I totally forgot about that until you mentioned it. Yeah. We've just been losing status lights.

**Brian:** Hey, give me back my status light Apple please.

**Marshall:** yeah. As long as I keep the camera one and the microphone one to let me know when that stuff's on.

**Brian:** You know, what I think is the reality here is that. More and more people just use their laptop plugged in 24/7. Like nobody's traveling. I don't know. Actually, I wouldn't say COVID is the reason for this, but yeah.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Over the last year. Definitely. For sure. Anyways, that's the only follow-up I had, you had a little bit.

**Brian:** Yeah, I have a little bit, Oh, we got a tweet from _Stacy Holmstead_ who asks, "Hey, is there a good podcasting app that will play both your regular and Sidebar episodes as well as my other podcasts? Thanks". And I wanted to take this moment to do a little PSA. We might have to do this, like every, hundred Patreon supporters. You do not have to listen to these episodes on Patreon. You do not need a separate app. So if you go to the Patreon, our profile after you have subscribed, there'll be a special RSS link and you can copy and paste that into any podcast app.
So for example, On _Pocket Casts_, which is my podcast app of choice. You can paste that into the search bar and it should get you there. And, that RSS feed will contain both Patreon episodes and Sidebar.
Although one other reminder, for new folks, like we only publish the Sidebar segment separately, more so is a backlog for future subscribers. So if you just want to hear the full episode, you can listen to the full episode. And if you just want to catch up on a specific sidebar from the backlog, that's what that's for.
So it's not like you're missing content. If you listen to the full episode.

**Marshall:** Yep.

**Brian:** Which is, it's kind of annoying that they clog up the RSS feed. Like it's a double post, but, you know, _Pocket Casts_ and like most podcasting apps have like an archive gesture. so you can just swipe it out of the way. All right. This week's Sidebar is actually a listener question from a Patreon.
I'll keep it anonymous because I didn't get permission to use the name, but this person messaged us and asked, _do you have any advice for working with the brand team on the product design system? It seems like branding only translates to landing pages and print. It feels like there should be a brand/product designer.
Someone who can apply a brand's personality to a product system._

**Marshall:** This is super interesting. Yeah.

**Brian:** Yeah. here's what I'll say. Oh, I feel like there is some tension in my experience between brand and product. they operate in different ways on different kinds of things, but if they aren't working together, they should be. And if you're working on a team where there is a communication gap or a process gap, or a silo or a wall, whatever you want to call it in between the two teams.
I think that's a problem. And what I'm finding, this is like something that I'm currently working on is, it just takes a little bit of extra effort and I'm working with some branding folks at GitHub who are very excited to work on product and on the products that I'm very excited to work with our branding people, because I think our brand and marketing design team is phenomenal, but it just requires a little bit of extra work to navigate the organizational sort of split, I would say, In the meantime, there are like smaller elements that can overlap.
Marshall, maybe you should dig into those.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I kind of see this as a Venn diagram where there's not a ton of overlap between the two circles, but there is. So maybe we should talk about the stuff that's in that, that overlap here. so the first thing that comes to my mind is logos. Right? You probably have a logo and, along with that color branding in your app, so if the color is orange, you probably got an orange logo and you probably got some orange buttons or at least accents in your app. And those should probably be the same orange Brian, or at least feel like the same orange.

**Brian:** a hundred percent. I mean, that's the easiest thing to do, right? Color.

**Marshall:** Color.
Yeah. And not just that main key color, but also potentially a suite of like secondary colors or accent colors that span the entire spectrum. So that when you're doing another thing that would be in that overlap, which is illustration, you have a consistent set of colors to work from, and everything is tied together through those colors.

**Brian:** Yeah, I've also found illustration to be an interesting one. where.. really in the last five years, more and more Illustration has made its way off the marketing page into product. Usually things like empty States or onboarding flows, sort of modals and error States, that kind of place has become a great way for brand personality, and differentiating illustration to shine through coming off the marketing page, into the product.

**Marshall:** Yeah. It's the voice of the product, right?

**Brian:** Yeah. And if you have a team that has created that and maintains it in such a way that product can use it correctly in product without muddying the the meaning of the illustration, that's a great, opportunity for overlap or at least collaboration, right?

**Marshall:** totally, yeah I think another area here is a copy. Right? So what is the tone of that voice, not only was the visual tone, but what kind of words do you use? Do you use contractions? Is it very formal? Is it casual? Do you use slang?

**Brian:** Title case, sentence case, even though that small thing. Yeah.

**Marshall:** Yeah, that goes a long way towards, reinforcing a brand in addition to like typography and all of that stuff, not just the visual look of how you're saying it, but like, what were the actual words you're using?
And that'll imply a lot about the brand in general, but all of that stuff appears in product, right?

**Brian:** totally. So if you're working in a place where brand and product are separate, have you experienced that? And do you have any tips for like navigating or bridging the gap between those teams?

**Marshall:** well, Brian, my experience at companies is long but limited. So I got two companies under my belt. One of them is Google. One of them is a slot machine company in Chicago. So no.

_Marshall and Brian, both laugh_

**Brian:** Okay. All right. Well, I guess the only thing I can add here is if a gap does exist, it is worth bridging. It just takes a little bit of extra effort. it seems like a lot of times the split is artificial. It's purely organizational, less than practical. And I think the two should overlap and that is really about how much brand is aware of your product. Like, do they know what's important about it? And if they don't, then obviously you're going to have a hard time selling the thing that you're building. So it's in your best interest to make sure that the brand team and people who design marketing pages and write copy for, selling or advertising your product.
know about what you care about and know how the thing works and how it looks and what it feels like to use, because that can all really influence the way that they work. And conversely, I think having brand come to product and say, look, these are some of the things that we're trying. like here's a new illustration style or some new colors or new patterns that we're working with.
Are there opportunities in product that we can surface this and sort of tie the two together? It's really about just doing the work to get those across. One example that has come to mind is Loom, Loom recently did a big product refresh and a brand refresh. And I was watching some of the tweets from Stuart Scott-Curran on Twitter, and he was saying that their brand and product teams are one. They have a single design team that umbrellas over brand and product. And so I'll have a link to his Twitter in the show notes. he might be a good person to follow and look at some of his recent tweets about the rebrand and the launch and learn something about how Loom is structured. just as a example, but yeah, I think it's important and if it it's worth working on and people notice, I think people notice a disconnected product and brand strategy, and you really don't want that.
You want it to be one company, one voice, it might require for you just jumping across organizational boundaries.

**Marshall:** Yeah, set up a regular sync.

**Brian:** Yeah, get that brainstorm going, that one-on-one

**Marshall:** just having like regular meetings and talking to people and just sharing what you're working on goes a long, long way. if only to create a relationship between those teams. So that like the next time you go ask them for something, they know who you are. You're not just some stranger out of nowhere.

**Brian:** Yes. Yep. That's a good point. Yeah, all right. Well, we hope that was helpful anonymous listener, but I would love to see here more examples of Brand and Product collaborating. I mean, I don't know, this is the most obvious example, but like Apple seems to have whatever their structure is. I wish we could learn more about it. Cause it seems.
Fucking perfect. Um, how do we do that? That's a great question. So if someone knows, hit me up and let's talk about it, that'd be great. All right. Well, that's the sidebar. if you didn't know, we are a listener supported podcast, which means that listeners like you actually make the show possible every single week. how that looks as you can support us on Patreon, we're on Patreon and starting for just a dollar a month. you can subscribe. And as a result, you get access to a special supporter only segment of the show called the Sidebar. It's like a bonus school things, or think of it as like a complete episode. If you're not subscribed to Patreon, you're basically getting like a half episode. So we'll always have an extra bonus question, a listener question or, some topic with a juicy design slant. So if you want to support us and get access to full episodes of the podcast, that's at patreon.com/designdetails. Today, we talked about how to get brand and product design teams to collaborate together and how that collaboration might work effectively. So if you wanna hear that that's a patreon.com/designdetails.
All right. A little bit, a proper episode. Follow-up

**Marshall:** Yeah. A little bit of follow-up. So last week, my cool thing. This is selfish Follow-up right. Last week, my cool thing was JoJi's new album Nectar..

**Brian:** All right. I'm going to stop you right there, Marshall. I have listened to this album since last Sunday, when we recorded I think I've listened to the album, maybe 150 times. I'm not even kidding. I just threw that shit on repeat for, from the time I sat down at my computer to the time I went to bed, God, ah, it's so good.

**Brian:** _laughs_

**Marshall:** You're welcome!

**Brian:** I mean, I don't want to like, over-hype it, but I really enjoyed it. Like every song was.. I actually there's a couple, I'm not a huge fan of, but for an album as big as it is. And for an artist I've never heard of before, I was just so impressed and so much, uh, stylistic range and, and different feels across the different songs.
It felt like a really nice journey. So anyways, I've had that on repeat, so thank you for the recommendation.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Well, I'm so happy to hear that you enjoyed it and you're not the only one. I got a tweet from Ollie, _TheOllieJT_ on Twitter said "Damn 2 for 2. Marshall knows my music preference better than Spotify." Cause I guess Robert Parker hit for him and so did Nectar. So yeah I just wanted to give you an opportunity to say how much you liked that album, Brian, and just prove how good of a musical selection person I am, you know,

**Brian:** well here, let me say this. I really enjoyed the album. The first song "Ew", I think it might be my least favorite song on the album. So if other people clicked play and didn't like the vibe of the first one, like me, keep going. But Marshall, you like, you liked the first song.

**Marshall:** yeah, I do. I mean, soaring strings, it feels like kind of a old classic, like something that would be on a Tarantino soundtrack or something like the backing strings and everything. I don't know. I really like it.

**Brian:** Well, awesome. Joji nectar.

**Marshall:** so Joji yeah. Another piece of follow-up. So when we're talking about work journals, something that I've been thinking about recently, and I've noticed, in my own behavior I found useful.
Is I'm using verbs very specifically. Right? So I start every bullet point with a verb And I use the same verbs over and over again. and this makes searching later a lot easier. Right? So for example, when I present a deck to people I say presented deck, and I have a link to that deck or whatever, but when somebody else presents a deck to me I say person shared whatever that deck is in the link to that thing. So, I kind of differentiate between when a deck is incoming and outgoing. Right. but similarly, across the things like either I attend a meeting or I lead a meeting or I participate in a thing, come up with a kind of a lexicon of verbs that work really well for you.
So that later when you're like, Oh yeah, I was in that sprint. Well, I know that when I use sprint, I like participate in a sprint. So I can just search for participate in this doc. And all of the sprints I've been in will show up. Right.

**Brian:** Man. That's nice. I can imagine like contributed to or helped with. And then when you are writing yourself review you just fucking Command+F everything you contributed to. That's awesome.

**Marshall:** You got it, dude, you got it. This is exactly what I'm doing. Cause I noticed that my last perf writeup, that it was a little bit harder to go through. Cause I wasn't that consistent with my verbs. So in this last cycle I've just been locked it down and come up with a good system that I think works.
But whatever works for you, as long as you're consistent about it, It'll pay off really well in the future.

**Brian:** I love it. This is like the incrementally correct work journal. And we're evolving it in real time. cause I haven't been doing this, but I'm now I'm going to start doing it because you know, once you say it's like, Oh shit, that's really obvious. This is cool.

**Marshall:** Bringing you along on the journey, Brian,

**Brian:** you, sir. All right. last bit of follow-ups.
So y'all we put a transcript up last week. Yeah, it's on GitHub. And, we had our first people contribute to editing transcripts, which is really, really cool. so shout out to _joeyjungle_, AKA Joey Pearlman And Geetha Kardahally. I hope I pronounced that correctly. Thank you Geetha and Joey, as a reminder, the transcripts are very, very rough exports. and we're just going to be throwing those on GitHub right now we have a directory on our repo link in the show notes called transcripts.
And if you Want to help out and just go through and spot a typo or a word that's incorrect and want to open a pull request. I'd love to hear it. I got a message from somebody that this was their first experience, opening a pull request on GitHub. And so if any of that is confusing or intimidating or weird, let me know one, because I would love to help you.
And two, this is also like selfishly user research for GitHub. if these flows suck, we'll fix them. So, yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Joey and Geetha, those first contributions to our transcipts.

**Marshall:** And they're good contributions. They're like they've cleaned up the transcripts amazingly.

**Brian:** Oh, these were like multi dozen line cleanups, like tons of shit. Yeah. So, so thank you. All right. Let's get into our main topic. So this week we have a listener question, which Marshall I feel like you're just going to nerd out on this. This feels like a question designed for you. this one comes from _vinnie329_ on GitHub.
He asked an issue on our repo. He says, _I would love to get both your takes on the one-hand myth that a lot of designers seem to buy-in to when designing for mobile. The myth suggests that all people use one hand to interact with their phones and so interfaces should be designed accordingly. This may have been true on the early smartphones which were smaller and where apps tended to be simpler.
However, with devices getting bigger and heavier it seems like people use both hands for more complex, high-stakes tasks (buying something) and one hand for simple, low-stakes tasks (scrolling through a feed). Is this what you guys have found to be true? And is there any recent research around how people use their hands to interact with their phones?_

_It would be super interesting to understand how you and Marshall think about this when designing for mobile!_, Oh wow. This was addressed to me. man, I love this question and, This is going to be one where I don't have research. I just have like experiences and some gut intuitions about like usability.
So if anyone actually has hard research on this, I would be down or Marshall, Maybe you do? but I'll just say that my first instinct is. I find myself wanting to bottom orient things as often as possible, but a lot of times it's not possible. but I see a lot of apps evolving in this direction and that feels correct, and it feels better to use.
And a good example for me that comes to mind is like the photos app, where not only do they have a tab bar to switch between contexts of what you're doing in photos. but they also have like a bottom oriented, segmented control that changes the scope of how you're viewing all of your photos by all week, month, year.
and that was like nice validation that yes, we got to move a lot of the stuff down to the bottom. I think for me, the, premise here actually. I feel it's almost inverted. I think, yeah. Our phones are getting bigger and heavier. Some more people use them with both hands, but I think that's a problem that can be solved by putting more navigation at the bottom.
Like if the phone is super heavy and it's super big, like sure. But if we can bottom orient more of our stuff, it actually requires you to use two hands less and it's going to actually free up a hand for someone. so I'm all about it. I try to do more of it, but it's just not always possible. One thing we're trying on the GitHub mobile apps is it's kind of like a floating action button, like a fab, but slightly different, but we're putting some floating buttons in the bottom right corner above the tab bar.
we like it so far. So I think we'll keep continue doing that. And we're exploring patterns of how to get lots of actions down there getting, actions that change depending on the context you're in that kind of thing. So, anyways, that I wanted to get my rant out of the way. Cause I want to hear what you have to say about bottom navigation.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, so I don't have recent research. I think the image that always pops in my head when I think about one-handed use is Luke Wroblewski's diagram that kind of like rainbow thing. We'll put it in the show notes, but yeah, basically the reach of the thumb as you can expect on a given device.
And, I think one thing to always keep in mind is we shouldn't assume that any given user has two hands to devote to a task at any given time, right. That might be permanent, that might just be because they're holding something in the other hand, or juggling, they got a kid something like that, that they can't let go off.
And they need to do this thing with one hand. I think it's a fair assumption to make, like you should make everything _thumbable_.

**Marshall:** _laughs_ I just coined that term Brian! _thumbable_.

**Brian:** trademark TM TM TM!

**Marshall:** TM Marshall by 2020, But yeah, I think, you're thinking isn't wrong to assume that from more intense tasks, people are more likely to put two hands on the phone, the same way that you turn down the radio, when you get close to where you're trying to go.
I guess that tracks but to assume that you can be more relaxed and how well you account for one handed use and harder flows, like I think that's kind of the challenge is to make all regardless of the flow to make it easy to use and, reachable and _thumbable_ is something that makes things easier to use.

**Brian:** This reminds me of one of the things that you've brought up on the show before, which is the fact that Apple does this and they encourage high priority navigation to be near the bottom of your phone. So you have the dock on the springboard with your four most frequently used applications. You have tab bars to get to the most core parts of an application from the bottom.
but they break their own rule when it comes to the rest of the stuff on springboard, which is - you can't force something to be the row above the docket. It's like, you always have to go top left to bottom right. Which is like aesthetically correct in the left to right reading language.
It's like, you start at the top left and you work your way to the bottom right. but from this usability principle, can you get to the important things with your thumb and one hand? it totally breaks. So there's some disconnect there right?

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is always kind of the question. When you have a feed is like, is it reverse chrono or chrono? Right? Is it like email or like text messages? do new things come in at the bottom or at the top? if they come in at the bottom, then there are a lot easier to reach. Right. But if they come in from the top, it makes a lot more sense from a chronological standpoint of like new things at the top.
That's how we expect notifications and emails and everything to work. So, on any given feed, I'm always like, should this be top down or bottom up? Bottom up always works better. Maybe you can contain that thing, such that the top isn't so far away, this is kind of what, Samsung's One UI does, is they just basically say nothing goes at the top.
We just put a big title and everything gets pushed down into the thumbable range. And, it works, if you want to scroll up, you can, but everything is initially reachable. I don't know about you, Brian, but when it comes to the keyboard, for example, like I have a 11 pro max and I have my keyboard shoved over to the right side of the screen.
It's like hidden inside the emoji menu or whatever, if you long press, but like I have my keyboard, doesn't go full width. It's all crammed over to the right side of the screen. Cause my thumb can't reach all the way over to the left without me dropping the damn thing. Right. Are you saying you probably got bigger hands than I do

**Brian:** maybe a tiny bit, but no, I can't stand the aesthetics of having a keyboard, not take up the full width.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I know. I've, I've gotten over it, but I got a swipey and I can't swipe, if I can't reach you, so,

**Brian:** I feel like one thing I've noticed. And this is where I actually have a lot of room to improve is where you put primary actions. And this is where material, I feel like they made some progress with the floating action button. I have a ton of problems with the fab personally. I don't like them, but I do like the idea of the primary thing that you're meant to do on this screen should be closer to the bottom so you can reach it.
but for me, even in iOS, it tends to be the case that primary actions get put in the bar, right? Like the top right of a nav bar. So if you look at a lot of the messages, like compose message is always in the top right. but I've also noticed a lot of apps are starting to switch to fabs, even on iOS, like things as a good example, the create new to-do lives at the bottom, outlook for iOS, which has an app I love has create email and create event in the bottom right.
and then other apps have started doing creative, like power user things, which are undiscoverable interactions with tab bars that maybe not everyone notices, but once you learn it, it saves you that stretch. So for example, most search inputs are at the top of the screen. So it's really annoying when you go to a search tab in an app and you then have to reach all the way to the top to focus on input.
A lot of apps have added a little custom handler. So if you either double tap on the search tab or long press on it, it'll just focus that search input for you. So an example of this would be outlook for iOS. Does this, we do this on the GitHub apps, if you long press on the Explorer tab right now, it'll just focus the search input there.

**Marshall:** so I actually, Apple's added this to the music app. If you tap again on the search tab, when you're already on the search tab, it'll focus the search field.
I'm so happy you brought this up too, by the way, Brian, because you're going exactly where I was about to go, which is to material.io. If you go to that, we'll have a link in the show notes to the bottom app bar section. But, in here, it shows, all of the stuff that you would normally expect to be at the top is now moved to the bottom. So you have this kind of combined fab and bottom bar, and that the hamburger, the three-line menu icon is actually in the bottom left than the top left.
And that just makes it a lot more reachable. Unfortunately, when you pop out that menu, guess where the most primary, first thing is going to be. At the top of the list. So I'm still running into that bottom-up and top-down thing.

**Brian:** How, how does this interface with bottom navigation, a lot of tab bars,

**Marshall:** Well, so you kind of have to make a choice, right? Either you have a bottom tab bar and you choose five and you don't need a side menu, or you put that stuff in the side menu, I guess. kind of mutually exclusive, but it's interesting the way they've thought about like, getting into the menu is a pretty common thing. Why is it so far away? And, I think to that point, the example that you used earlier, like a messages, how often do you create a new message? You're usually just talking to people you've already been talking to.
So putting it at the top doesn't really matter so much. It's the stuff that the bottom right. Yeah. it makes sense to me that it's there. So if you're going to have to make that choice, you should be sure that the things you're putting up top are used less. And usually those creation things are like that.
Unless you're a post heavy application, in which case you might want to make it a fab or put it in that bottom bar,

**Brian:** yeah.
So. I wanna bring this back. We talked about MagSafe in the Sidebar and Magsafe is coming back to the iPhones. And one of the interesting conversations happening around that is like, what other accessories besides charging we'll use the magnet and, you know those pop sockets right?

**Marshall:** Oh, yeah. I mentioned it in the last episode.

**Brian:** Have you ever used one?

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. Uh, no, I haven't used it, but I'm fully aware.

**Brian:** I mean, I do not like the look of them. I don't like the way they stick onto your phone, but my goodness, they are very practical and useful. I was actually used one today on a friend's phone. And, I'm wondering if that will come as like a first party MagSafe accessory at some point, because that frees up having to balance phones on your pinkie, basically, which actually makes reaching any part of the screen really easy.

**Marshall:** that's a good point. And speaking of, iPhones like the new iPhone mini, I think gives this kind of an answer to this problem of not being able to reach the whole damn screen. Like Personally, I'm very drawn to that, device specifically for that reason. Like, even if it's not as powerful or it doesn't have as good of cameras or whatever, like that's not what I'm buying it for. I'm trying to fit in my pockect and reach corner.

**Brian:** I really want to hold one before I make a purchasing decision. But it's comical that they had to advertise it as look, we made a phone that fits in your Palm. It's like, huh?
What went wrong somewhere four or five years ago? I guess, yeah, to wrap this up is like the hardware will continue to evolve.
There's going to be accessories. And, but I think there's still just enough design patterns that you can lean on for more accessible, one handed navigation or action taking that you could use and take advantage of and some people will notice maybe most people won't, but the ergonomics are there and you should do it if you have the opportunity.
And yeah, I like what you pointed out Marshall, like there are primary actions on a screen that might not be super common, or maybe it's not even a primary action, but like creating a new iMessage

**Marshall:** Important. It needs to be surfaced. It needs to be there and visible but probably not use that often

**Brian:** Yeah. throw it in the nav bar, I like that

**Marshall:** Yep. And luckily we can lean on gestures for a lot of the other stuff, Right? like back doesn't matter if it's in the top left, we got swipe. Right? And we even have, what's it called? What's the thing re... Oh shit.

**Brian:** Reachability

**Marshall:** Reachability, there you go. We have that if we really need to. I only ever use that on accident.

**Brian:** Yeah, I only ever used it on accident for people who don't know if you're on like the latest. IPhones post iPhone 10, uh, where that little handle exists at the bottom of the screen. If you swipe down only on that section, it invokes reachability and it
might be a setting you have to turn on. I can't remember if it's on by default.

**Marshall:** I wouldn't assume anybody uses that or knows how to use it.
Do you know anybody who uses it?

**Brian:** No, but I mean, it is interesting, like if that was actually discoverable, I mean, they clearly built this to solve this particular problem with like, how do we help people reach things in the navbar?

**Marshall:** It happened right around iPhone 6, I think when the phones got big.
anyways, well, hopefully that was helpful. Thank you for letting me nerd out a bit on this kind of stuff

**Brian:** Maybe, if people know of like really cool bottom oriented navigation patterns, I'd love to hear. like a few for me, I love things the way that they have a lot of creation happens at the bottom of the screen. I love Halide, Halide the camera app. Every camera control is at the bottom or it's a gesture on top of the view finder.
I dunno photography terms. But those are a couple examples of like really great bottom oriented navigation and it's so practical. Like you want to create a quick to-do while you're on the go you're, whipping out your phone and trying to snap a quick picture, like get that stuff in a position where you can get to it very easily.
I love it. So if anyone has examples, it'd be cool to hear those on Twitter. Maybe.

**Marshall:** Keep it _thumbable_

**Brian:** _thumbable_

**Marshall:** all right. Cool.

**Brian:** Speaking of cool things,

**Marshall:** Yeah. do you want to go first? I think you might've given up the plot a little bit earlier.

**Brian:** Oh yeah. my cool thing is a tool that I've really gotten into using at work it's called Loom and maybe other people are using this too. I think it's a loom.com. And what is Loom? Loom, it's a screen recorder with better user experience. I used to use Kap to record screen demos. K A P.
And it's a great one. I still use that occasionally. there's two things that I like about Loom, the first is it automatically has a little circle that it places in the corner that records your face while you're recording your screen. It's optional. You can turn that on or off, but I like it. I like watching people present and being able to see their face and their expressions and hand gestures at the same time.
Especially since we're doing so much asynchronous online work right now. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is, the second you hit stop, it automatically opens your browser to a URL where that video is usually already uploaded. They're kind of uploading as you record. So that particular thing saves so much time.
Like if you just want to record a quick video, one minute, send it to coworker to get their thoughts and an idea, you just record, second you hit stop, you have a URL that you can just grab on your clipboard and share. so I love that particular feature of it. They have a pretty generous, free plan, but I actually just went ahead and upgraded, it's like a hundred dollars for a year.
Which gives you, I think, unlimited uploads and I've been on an upload spree, man. I'm uploading shit all the time and I love it. And a lot of the designers on our team at GitHub have also taken to using it, to, to show prototypes or explain ideas or things that they're working on. And it's great. So I like it.
and yeah, like we mentioned, they just did a big rebrand and redesign and they did a really cool thing with that redesign. They actually had their design team record looms explaining why they made certain design decisions they did, which was cool. It was like very transparent, but also very intimate.
It's like, wow, I'm watching the designer who made this thing, explain why they made this thing. that doesn't happen super frequently for company redesigns. And, uh, yeah, I watched a couple of those and it was awesome. So I guess now I will find a couple of those tweets and put links in the show notes, but pretty good try

**Marshall:** Man. Well, my, my mind is racing. Brian you've, made me think of so many things. One of them is there was a screen recording demo thing that came out recently where the guy was like super kind of snarky and like just fucking, what was that called

**Brian:** it's called mmhmm..

**Marshall:** Oh yeah, mmhmm!
That's what it was. I knew it was fuck. Yeah. I was like, is it hello

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. You sent me that product video or it's like the marketing video for it, where the marketing video was just using the product. It was very so good, it was very funny

**Marshall:** yeah. the was guy demoing. Yeah, so there's that too check that out. That was interesting. Also Descript, which is the editing app that we use to,

**Brian:** oh buddy.

**Marshall:** they have video editing now and screen recording and all sorts of stuff. It'll be interesting to see how people use that.

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** And the last thing was, it reminds me of when orange box came out, which was the famous valve multi game release that included portal, They had like a demo version where you could walk through the game And there'll be a little like quotation mark icons floating around each level and you could go and, and interact with those. And it would be the developers talking to you about why they made the decisions in the game or at least for that specific level. Super cool, man. I totally dig that stuff, especially coming from the mouth of the person who helped work on it, you know?

**Brian:** Yeah, it's cool. And I understand why a lot of companies choose not to do that. I think, for a lot of people the reason is we don't actually want this to be about individual people and individual decisions. It's about the bigger picture of the company, the brand, this is like Apple, right? Like you never know who worked on a thing.
It's all just part of the big monolith. but it's, yeah. That's why it's refreshing. I think to see the humans behind a product and understand this trade offs there. But, I selfishly appreciate that. Cause I can go in and learn a thing or two.

**Marshall:** Totally. Well, cool thing.

**Brian:** what you got?

**Marshall:** Yeah, I got a YouTube channel for you, Brian!

**Brian:** Oh, back on, back on the YouTube.
All right. I we've swung back from one of the two things. Got it.

**Marshall:** Yeah, this I ping pong. I vacillate. so this one is an interesting one. Uh it's it's a channel called _Cracking the Cryptic_. And what is your experience with Sudoku, Brian?

**Brian:** I like it. Uh, there was that video that went around about the guy solving the like impossible Sudoku or something that went viral and very enjoyable

**Marshall:** Oh, maybe it was he a British guy named Simon with like a kind of soothing voice. Okay. well maybe that was this, I don't know about the viral video you're talking about, but that might've come from this channel. So yeah, basically this guy, I think there was actually two guys, but the one I liked that I've seen the most videos from his name is Simon

**Brian:** uh, yes, it was this channel. I sorted videos by most popular. And the 2nd one with 2 million views is called "The Miracle Sudoku" that came out, five months ago. And it looks like it started with 2 numbers and there is bunch of rules.

**Marshall:** Yeah. And that's what all these are like, he solves these crazy, crazy Sudoku puzzles that I would have no chance of ever solving, but he walks you through his thought process step-by-step as he's thinking about it and he thinks out loud and I've learned so much about solving Sudoku just by watching this guy.
meanwhile, it's kind of a nice like, ON in the background while I'm working kind of a thing they're long videos from like half an hour to an hour, depending on how difficult the puzzle is. But, I don't know. It's just kind of like soothing background stuff or even to watch it's, it's fun to learn. I don't know.
It was a weird cool thing to suggest, I have been watching a lot lately

**Brian:** no, that's cool. I mean, I would recommend everyone go and watch that "the Miracle Sudoku" video. They have another video with more views, 5 million views,

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** but just go and watch at least the one. It, it was fun.

**Marshall:** Dude, if I derived as much joy from anything as he derives from putting numbers in boxes, like I'd be a totally different person, man.

**Brian:** I don't know. I feel like you get, on an equally sort of craftsmen, like level with talking about a visual design.

**Marshall:** sure.. sure.. sure..

**Brian:** You know what, I'm looking at this channel and their logo, not great. it's clever, but it basically says racking, their cryptic.

**Marshall:** Yeah. they did a Kickstarter and they have a book out and they actually have two apps. There's like two Sudoku apps on the app store right now. neither is designed very well. I've considered contacting them and doing a little bit of a pro bono work just to make this stuff look better, but I don't have time for stuff like that,

**Brian:** uh man, but you should beacuse your Solitary app that you never finished was gorgeous.

**Marshall:** Yeah, no, I finished it enough to scratch the itch, you know? Anyways, cool things Brian.

**Brian:** All right, well, this is been Episode 370. We hope you enjoyed it.

**Marshall:** arrivederci

**Marshall:** arrivederci

**Brian:** _laughs_
All right now you're just going through Inglourious Basterds. That was good.
Oh, man. Brad Pitt's character in that is fantastic.

**Marshall:** Gorlami..

**Brian:** _laughs_

**Marshall:** There's a really good, I don't know if you've seen the channel red means record. I think that's, what's called red means recording. he basically. makes songs out of clips of stuff. It's an amazing channel. This is like extra bonus cool thing.
And there's one where he took that clip of

**Brian:** Fuck. Yeah. Gorlami.. All right. I'm going to watch this immediately. After we hit stop recording.
