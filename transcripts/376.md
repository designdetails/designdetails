## 376: Shipping Quality UI

**Marshall:** Uh, Brian, I have a theory.

**Brian:** A boy.

**Marshall:** I have a theory that the number of brain cells I have left is directly proportional to the number of days I have left before vacation.

**Brian:** Uh, So very few

**Marshall:** Yeah. I'm working on like a one-to-one ratio.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. Actually I guess four at this point. So
running low,   
Welcome to episode 376 of the design details podcast. I'm Brian

**Marshall:** And I'm Marshall Bach. Welcome back for another episode, Brian, how you doing?
 
 **Brian:** you know, what's like senior-itis but just it's December.

**Marshall:** no, that's senior-itis I, yeah, I know what you're talking about and I have it. I have it hard.

**Brian:** yeah. I mean, I know you've got it hard. I'm like getting there. I think this time next week, I'm going to be Jones and for just a little bit of vacation time, but you know, things are good. Uh, moving along.

**Marshall:** Cool. Let's do a relatively quick show here today. I think we got some tight topics to get through. So here we

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. For good questions up ahead. All right. Before we get into it y'all Oh my God. Uh, so everyone came through this week. Uh, we have another big round of support from some new, very important

**Marshall:** Yeah. The VIPs are coming in waves, man, like huge mega list. This is great. Awesome to see.

**Brian:** it's like,
this is the best thing to see, but also it just means that this very special segment called Brian fucks up the pronunciation of your name, is just even more brutal. So last week was probably rough this week. We'll see, here we go. Huge shout outs to our new, very important pixels. Matt Crowley Yannick.
Megan learn. See Anderson. John Tyrrell, Matt Macron, John George sample, James Bartlett, Kramer, Canfield, James Smet
 tattoo.
Sophie bond. Graham bushel, Renata Venn, Trini Alex binder, Johnny Turla. Hey, Johnny sent me the pronunciation. I was like, ah, I don't know if I'm going to get that. Uh, sorry, Johnny. And finally last but not least. Jason you.
   Wow.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Uh, my favorite segment, Brian butchers. Your names? Yeah.
Hey,

**Brian:** you know, say it with confidence and, a good tempo and no one will notice except for that one, one person.

**Marshall:** The only person that matters to yeah.

**Brian:** Yeah. Very low percentage of errors in this batch

**Marshall:** Okay. High-impact low percentage. Yeah. Some good names in there though. Bond Sophie bond. That's some good shit. John George sample, it makes me want to buy the full version.

**Brian:** That's going to cost you.

**Marshall:** thanks everybody. What a great list. Holy shit.
Well, welcome to all the VIPs.

**Brian:** welcome. And yeah, let's take you right into the sidebar. All right. This week, sidebar, we have a kind of, I dunno, maybe this is spicy. Maybe it's not, this is a question we got into DM from an anonymous listener who asks, how long should you work at a company before you should move on? Does working in a company for too long, start to look bad to recruiters because you might be settled into the company and role, or you might be too used to working a certain way. I believe that in San Francisco, two years is already long in three years is the max, but many other cities around the world are not as fast paced.
I think you talked about this in the past. Uh, I forgot to mention. Another downside. This was a follow-up message. I forgot to mention another downside for working too long. For example, more than three years at a company might be because then they think that your experience is too specific to that role slash industry.
And you'd start to get boxed in. So Marshall just hit me with some gut feels when you read this question.

**Marshall:** Well, if three years is the max, then I'm like two and a half times that max at this 

**Brian:** You're S you're at what? Seven, eight.

**Marshall:** uh, just past eight, I think at Google and, I worked at the company before that, the last company
for eight years as well. So yeah. Uh, I always. I hoped it was interpreted as a sign of loyalty and, you know, uh, you know, the ability to like, follow through on something.
And I dunno, I got a job at Google after eight years at the same company. So maybe it's not that bad, but I don't know. What do you think? How long what's your longest stint?

**Brian:** Yeah. I mean, I'm in it. I think I was two years of buffer a year and three quarters at Facebook a year and three quarters at spectrum. And I just crossed two years at get hub.
 so I think we can work our way through the questions.
Like one, does it look bad to recruiters? I'm not convinced that this looks bad. 

**Marshall:**  I think there is a too short. I'm not sure there's a too long,

**Brian:** Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I think there's a too short. I feel like recruiters might be looking more at the size of company or something. Like, I think a more useful heuristic would be like, has this person always worked at a big company or do they have experience at a startup? that might be something a founder might consider like, Oh, this person has been at Google for eight years.
They might not. Or they might struggle in a different kind of environment. and. The opposite is true. Like this person has only ever worked at three person startups. Should we hate bringing them on it? Big company. It might just be a culture shock. I don't think that's a deal breaker though. The second question is like around pigeonholing. are you worried about getting too pigeonholed if you stay in a role for too long? Like, are you afraid of becoming the gaming designer or like, I don't know.

**Marshall:** well, not anymore. I'm the design systems

**Brian:** Yeah. You,

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah, I think it's, I think that's kind of up to you and what's available in the company. Like how much lateral or upward mobility you have, at Google it's, you know, it's like a billion, different companies under one company. So like, If you want to work on something that's very user facing.
You can do that. If you want to work on something, that's not, if you want to work on something that goes to space, you can do that. You know what I mean? Like there's a wide variety of things to do. And just because you're at one company doesn't mean you were necessarily in the same role that entire time.
but if you were. Does that role encompass the responsibilities that you'll have at the new place, in which case then? Yeah, you got a lot of experience doing that thing. I don't, it's hard to get boxed in to product design, unless it's a very narrow thing. It's like everything is product design at any company, it's kind of all the same thing just at different scales.
So unless you've been like doing something very, very bespoke and unique, or it's like, I make, I can't even think of something

**Brian:** Well, I can think of something cause this, I think might be true, but I just don't think it's as big of a problem as a lot of people have it in their heads is like in FinTech. I think people who work in FinTech for a long time
kind of become

**Marshall:** Financial technology. Is
that, is that what you mean, 

**Brian:** Yes. Like. You work at PayPal for two years and you go work at square for two years, then you go work for Stripe for two years.
It's like, okay, I'm seeing a pattern, but that's a double-edged sword. So on one edge, yeah. You might get pigeonholed to that industry and you might get more outreach from other financial technology companies, but the benefit is you are building up, A lot of specialized knowledge about that industry, which requires a ton of context.
Like you learn about dealing with money around the world, multiple currencies, crossing borders, taxes, regulations, like there is a wealth of knowledge that just has to be accumulated in certain kinds of industries. The longer you're in. Sure. So harder to get out, but you're also probably going to be operating at a much higher level, have, more impact,

**Marshall:** Be more likely to be that person who gets hired when you do move, because you'd be like, I'm an expert in this thing. You can't just find an expert walking off the street, you know?

**Brian:** Yeah. That's like all the design skills can transfer between many kinds of industries and jobs, but like in certain industries, there is just enough context that, it's like this bonus. It's like, you can't just study and learn that you have to kind of like go experience that industry for many years build up that context.

**Marshall:** So what about too short, Brian? Uh, there's, there's this trope in the city in San Francisco of nine months to a year and then skipping and going to the next thing, I think that's interpreted by companies as. You've skipped on your last employers.
As soon as the kind of introductory period was over and left to go do something else, you don't know what you want to do, and you might do that same thing to me, I'm trying to hire an employee. That's going to be dependable for a long time. And, that might be a turnoff, right?

**Brian:** Yeah, I think that's a pretty. Rational line of thinking, I guess there's one caveat here, which is, I don't think people should feel like they need to stay in a company if it's a toxic culture or they're really unhappy, or they have an abusive manager, like these are all reasons to just get the fuck out and like, don't worry about the short tenure on your resume.
That can be easily explained.

**Marshall:** Yup. But
if you have a pattern 

**Brian:** Yeah. If you see a string of nine months, nine months, nine months, I guess that would be a little bit weird. That would be a person I'd want to talk to and be like, tell me more like what's going on here? Why do you keep skipping? Especially because I think one thing that I've started to realize, you know, as I mentioned, I've only really been at places for a couple of years, but it's usually towards the end of that couple of years, you kind of, I've been hitting my stride like around my year, Mark at Facebook, around year and a half year at buffer, like now two years of get hub.
I feel like I've built up enough context about my coworkers, the way the company operates, how we're growing. I like have good relationships with my cross-functional peers. Like I'm, I know a little bit about what's going on in such a way that I can actually accomplish things like I know the right person to go talk to, to get a thing done.
And that takes time to build up. And every time you switch companies, you're resetting that counter to zero, which is a little painful. So I, think two years, I mean, I'm being hypocritical. I think tier is on the lower end. I would say like two to four is where you start doing the good work.
Like you've gotten

**Marshall:** you learn the ropes. Yeah. Yeah. This is, this is my element to take it back to gaming because that's how I think of things. But like, this is the lament of like the console cycle is by the time the next generation of consoles are coming out, the games that are coming out for the old console are like really utilizing every.
Last bit of performance and graphical fidelity because they've learned how to use this system. And then you start all over with PS five, you know, so. You hit your stride in those later years and the, uncertainty and the mistakes that you might've made in those previous years are no longer a concern. And you can just go at full speed and that's what you want. That's what the company wants from you too. Right?

**Brian:** Yeah, well, I mean, this gets into my last point. Like there is a tension, especially in San Francisco, in Silicon Valley where the reason people are switching is because the advantage to switching is so high. people can switch jobs every two years and consistently bump their salary. 10, 20, 30%. Get new stock options in some new company.
Like it's a great way to accumulate wealth and quickly grow title. That's why we have 22 year old creative directors at startups and heads of design and all this kind of stuff. Like sure. They're talented, but there is a culture and system that incentivizes people to do that financially and from a title and scope perspective.
So I think that's. Probably the wrong incentive. I wish it was different. Like I wish there was enough incentive to stay at companies and more companies, prioritized internal hiring internal promotion for leadership roles, knew how to. Be fair with equity grants and compensation bumps so that they could remain competitive without having to just like lose people every, couple of years.
So for me, if I see, I try to look at like bundles of people. So like if I see a bundle of people that have kind of worked at one or two companies, those people had really long, 10 years there I'm like, okay, those companies probably had something figured out. Like it says more about the company culture to me than the individual designers.
So there's probably not a right answer to this is, is perhaps the, the final answer. It's
like, it depends. Right.

**Marshall:** well, it always depends. Yeah. And I think we've figured out that there's a floor, but there isn't necessarily a ceiling. unless you want to do something wildly different, 

**Brian:** I feel like you could have a really, really interesting conversation with somebody who's tried. Five different jobs in 10 years and someone who's tried one job in 10 years, I'm sure they both have really interesting experiences and totally different like skills and things that they've learned that they could bring to the table.
So neither of those are really a red flag for me, but yeah, anything lower. It's just
a good conversation waiting to happen. 
All right. Thank you for asking the question. This has been the sidebar. If you didn't know, we're listener supported podcast, that means that every week listeners like you support the show to make that. So it's possible. It's pays for all of our recording equipment, our software subscriptions, all this kind of stuff that we pay for every month and in return supporters get access to a supporter.
Only segment of the show called the sidebar.

**Marshall:** sidebar.

**Brian:** I was waiting for it this time. The sidebar is like basically an extra half of the show. It's like an extra. cool thing or an extra listener question or, or a story from one of our experiences. And today we answered a bonus listener question asking How long is too long to stay at a single job? So if you want to hear more about that and support the show at the same time, had the Patriot on.com/design details. Support starts for just a dollar a month. We tried to make it as approachable. And accessible as possible. So thank you to everyone supporting the show.
And if you are enjoying it, please consider heading to patrion.com/design details

**Marshall:** cool.
Let's do some follow up.

**Brian:** Okay, tiny Paul Marshall. So last week, Spotify released their whole light. Spotify wrapped, you know, their annual re individualized review of, of your stuff. And we got a bunch of tweets of people sending screenshots or design details was like one of their top podcasts for the year.

**Marshall:** So cool.

**Brian:** I just want to say is really cool.
It was,

**Marshall:** Yeah. Thank you. Yeah, that's very, uh, reassuring until like, Oh, some people do listen to this show.

**Brian:** Someone someone tweeted that they listened to nine episodes in one day or something like that. I was like,

**Marshall:** I'm sorry. Hopefully they good.  Actually, I have a friend who's listening backwards through the show, a colleague of mine who's, uh, listening to the shows in reverse chronological order. So I'm sure that's very interesting. Especially going back through 2020 it's like things get progressively better, I guess.

**Brian:** It must be just like every week is little nugget of like, Oh, that's what they were referring to. Cause you know, we
always refer to old episodes like, Oh, we've talked about this in the past. And for him, that's something he can look forward to. He's like, Ooh, I wonder what the, the original point was

**Marshall:** Yeah. Putting the cart before the horse there a little bit, but yeah.

**Brian:** Yeah.
All right.
We have two tweets this week we wanted to call out. So the first one comes from Sam Mason. Sam says, following up on the icon, talk from three 75, do you ever see Apple introducing icon packs? I would imagine that them being who they are a first step would simply be allowing people to use the legacy icons from the ecosystem.

**Marshall:** Nope, never. They want to do this. We don't even have old wallpapers on iPhone. Like you get like one generation back or something like that. 

**Brian:** yeah.

**Marshall:** just goes away.  Kind of, yeah. I mean, you can download that stuff, but yeah. It's coming from Apple. No, I, no, I don't think they'll ever do it.

**Brian:** Yeah, I don't think they'll do it. If anything, I'm amazed that they kind of made these very small concessions to people who are using the shortcuts workaround to set custom app icons on their home screen. Like it used to be that if you tapped on one of those, it would open the shortcuts app and then switch it to the app.
And they, they shipped a fixed to bypass that. So they kind of winked at people and they're like, Hey, it's cool. You know? But I don't think they'll do anything first party to let you really override

**Marshall:** I think that's a solve for more than just that particular use case. I think it made other use cases just as clunky and cumbersome. 
Sure, sure, sure. Yeah.    Sam, I don't think this will ever happen.

**Brian:** Yeah.
All right. Second tweet comes from Priscilla. Then who says, would love to see you guys filmed while creating podcasts so you can see your lovely faces and actually place a face to the name. Maybe you'd even get some ad revenue from YouTube. Marshall,

**Marshall:** my beautiful face. Yeah. Uh, you don't want to see this? I think that's, um, we've considered it. Right. And even like Brenda and I even played around with having a video series too, but it's just the amount of production that's necessary for video. Maybe we can do like. Maybe we'll do a bonus episode or something like that, where we do a video chat, because I find it is really helpful when I'm watching YouTube channels to like see the person's face and actually know, you know, I do the thing on the show where, uh, I'm on the, in your right ear.
This is Marshall. Hi. Uh, I'm in your right ear and Brian's in your left ear. So you can kind of differentiate us if, if, if you're not used to the difference between our voices, but I am not presentable most times that we record this podcast, so yeah.

**Brian:** yeah, maybe someday. All right. Thanks for the tweet though. Let's move on to the main topic. This one is another DM question. So we'll leave it anonymous. This question asks, should designers perform UI reviews after developer implementation? Or should QA be responsible for that? I think it's the job for designers since we're the ones that created the mocks and have the sensitivity to the finer details.
Like typography and spacing. But my boss, the product manager done, done, done thinks that the UI reviews should be done by a QA. I'd like to know how other companies handle it before presenting my argument to him. Hmm. I love it. Building a case. Look at this. I feel like this is something we've talked about,
right?
Like build a case and present your

**Marshall:** have evidence. Yep.

**Brian:** to listen to the show.

**Marshall:** Patria, patrion.com/design details. Um, yeah, bit of both,
right?

**Brian:** just going to say yes. Well, okay, sure. Yes. Yeah. Why not? Uh, I think QA seems to specialized. I don't have QA.
I don't think I've ever worked with QA.

**Marshall:** We have QA, but QA does something different than a UI review. Like a launch review. Like I'm, if I'm in a laundry view, a UX laundry view, I'm looking at all those things that you said, type biography, spacing. That's my job. I'm also making sure things aren't broken or whatever, but the QA person goes through.
Every fucking permutation that it could possibly be like signed in, signed out, drops of your conductivity. Like there's, there's a million different other things to test and they can have those, then I'm fine with them taking those. And it's important that they do because I don't want to do them.
I just want to look at like, does it match the mock if it matches the mock and all of the behavior is matching, then we're good.
 
 **Brian:** So that QA role that you've described sounds really, really useful, but even still specialized, like, I don't think I've ever worked with somebody that does that. Maybe at Facebook, there were people that did that. And I just like, literally never knew about them

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah, they were. I'm sure they were there. You just didn't know about it.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. Well, let me hear you this. So part of the question that threw me off is should designers perform UI reviews after dev implementation

So one thing that we've been doing on my teammate get hub, which is fucking awesome. Like I love that our engineering team does this is. Almost every poll requests or at least every poll request that touches the interface. They'll include screenshots in the PR. And they'll either mention me or, my partner Kristoff and ask one of us to approve the poll request.
And that gets our eyes on every single thing going in. And, you know, sometimes obviously like, Things ship that we wish were slightly different, time constraints, blah, blah, blah. But at least we have our eyes on, we have a chance to say like, uh, before you merged this, like, can you do this one small thing?
And then  once all those PRS are in and there's like a thing ready to ship. Yeah. Then we might do like a pre-launch review. And I also do like a post-launch it's like, I'm always just looking at the UI. Cause then I use the thing and I'm like, Oh, there's this one thing I noticed that. Uh, we looked at it.
We thought it was weird. Now that I'm using it more, I've used it for a week. It also feels weird. We should change it.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, I prefer a process that is like iterative throughout of like, While I'm designing it and just weighing in PM is weighing in, you know, making sure that like the thing I'm designing is technically feasible. We can actually build it. And then once the designs are approved and it's done once it starts getting built, I'm standing over shoulders.
Well, not anymore, but like I'm virtually standing over shoulders, making sure that, things are working as intended and behaviors are, as I designed them, But once it's out. Yeah. Then I, then I'm using it and yeah, there's always this list while I'm designing it, there's a list of things that can't make it into this design that I want to do later after it's built, there's a list of things that I want to get fixed, that won't be able to be fixed until after it's already launched.
And then after it's launched, there's some other things that I come up with is like, okay, for V2, this is what we're going to do, et
cetera. Like, yeah, there's always this list of.

**Brian:** Always. Just as an example, like, it's good timing. Cause I did this exact thing today. Just to illustrate the point. So we have a test flight build out for our iOS app, which is seated first to staff. And then it goes to like a pool of beta testers. And so an engineer and I just grabbed the latest staff build.
I shared my screen, pulled up my phone on the QuickTime movie recorder, so he could watch them using my phone. I think zoom can also let you share from directly from your phone. and we just. went through all of the features and like poked at the thing while I was screen-sharing. So it's like, it was already kind of built kind of ship.
Cause technically like users were going to see it. It's going to go out into a beta. but we still were QA like kind of throughout this whole process. I, I feel like, I don't know, Marshall, maybe it just is my experience with Silicon Valley startup culture. But this idea of. The design, like going through discreet stages, where at some point it's no longer your job to care about the UI that just rubs me like the wrong way.
I feel like the separation of, Oh, well, it's not your job check the UI. That's the QA team's job. It's like, well, no, like we're all here to ship really good software. And we're like all part of the same team. It doesn't make sense to just say, ah, it's not my job anymore. Like I don't care or it doesn't matter anymore.
It's someone else's problem. I never really liked that.

**Marshall:** Yeah, no, that's, it's yours. From the beginning to the end, uh, even efforts shipped you're responsible for it unless you've moved to a different team or something. Yeah. I always feel ownership of the thing, especially as it relates to shame of it not being perfect or the way that I wanted to, you know,

**Brian:** so, can we maybe spend a little more time on this problem of when things ship, like let's say stuff gets through QA, it gets through your designer view. It's not exactly how you want it, but you have this list of things that you want to fix. Polish items. How do you personally go about getting that prioritized or maybe back channel up to the engineers and be like, Hey, do you want to do me a favor and like, go fix this thing.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I mean, Yeah, I think it's there's different priorities, right? So there's like PM priority you X priority enj priority. And sometimes those are in conflict with one another. A thing that is very important to you. X might not be important at all to end your PM, but, uh, if vice versa, But I think you just have to call those out and then come to an agreement.
usually the zeros get fixed regardless of where they come from, the ones get fixed later, uh, probably before the next launch and the twos get fixed, like within the next quarter or so.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. We have, uh, P zeros and , but today we had a meeting where someone was like, I think this is the P zero dot five. And I lost it. I'm like, I don't think we can do that. Yeah, yeah. Whole numbers please. yeah. Yeah. We break that up as well. I think there is a temptation when you're doing prioritization like that to say, Oh, well, it's just a visual change.
So it's automatically like a P two or something like that. I think it's worth fighting for the meaningful visual changes. Make those appease zero. And that I think also takes a certain kind of organizational culture or, workflow or team ethic to how you care about sort of the craft and the excellence of the thing that's being built.
Where if nobody else agrees that visual work could ever be a P zero, then it never will be. But if you can start to make the case for it and fight for it and get it to be P zero, then you're going to ship your fixes. Right. but as long as the team doesn't care about it or respect it. It'll always be the
and just never get out the door.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I think it's good to have a, an agreed upon common understanding of what a P zero is, or at least what. Uh, you could even like make it specific and call it like a UX zero, right. As opposed to just a, a P zero and say, this is, this is a UX is zero. And here's what UX is. Zero means.
This is something that breaks a user experience. This is something that causes confusion, duh. define these so that it's very clear, like, Hey, look at this meets the criteria of what a UX is. Zero bug is we got to fix this cause it breaks the experience in some way.

**Brian:** Yeah, I find that those. In my experience basically ended up being pretty binary. It's like for us P zeros are the thing will not work. If we do not build this. And then P ones are like, nice to have.

**Marshall:** Yeah. 

**Brian:** right.
Well, I guess that's our answer. Anonymous asker. Yes. Always, always be reviewing, 

**Marshall:** ABR reviewing.

**Brian:** So let's get some cool things in and get you out of here. I'll go first. My cool thing this week is a person on Twitter, who I have discovered, and Boyle boy, I think you're going to like this on Marshall. So Robbie Tilton at Robbie Tilton on Twitter is making these videos. I think he's a game maker, but he's putting these videos on his Twitter account.
Where he's exploring sort of augmented reality games. And he has this series he's been doing in November called trading cards. So if you scroll down a little bit on his feed, Marshall, you'll see, uh, like on November 18th trading card number seven. And it's these like a, our trading cards that exist on your phone.
And like, as you move your phone, the card will tilt and it's like this 3d space behind the card. It's this really weird. Interesting, cool. visual effect and I found this guy's Twitter and just scrolled and scrolled and scrolled. And there's a ton of really cool work on this account, that you should look at.
He's like playing with, digital toys, like imagine that action figure in a box that is only digital and it's on your phone and you can like spin the box around and open the box and take the thing out and like manipulate the toy. But it's. On your phone, you can imagine that also existing and maybe like an AR kind of, experience.
Anyways. I thought it was really cool. And it reminded me of something that we've talked about and kind of dreamed about for awhile, which is like a heart stone, like game experienced in augmented reality where you have cards, but they're digital, so they can do really cool things, but you can play them on a real surface and,  

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is super cool, man. it's got kind of like those old hologram cards where it's like the, the foil hologram kind of a thing. But yeah, this, this window into a 3d space is super cool. I love it.
 Cool thing, Brian. Good. Find. Uh, my cool thing is a game, but unlike my previous cool thing, games of late, uh, I actually played this one instead of just watching it on YouTube. Cause I made the time bro. I made the time. yeah, so I got Spiderman, Myles Miralis And Spider-Man?
 Brian, it's an experience that. There's the joke, like, all of the articles that came out after the first Spider-Man or like, it makes you feel like you're Spiderman and it, it became like a trope of like every single article said that, but it was fucking true. It made you feel like Spiderman. You like when you're swinging through the city at sunset and New York.
Oh my God. God, it's beautiful. Holy shit. I love it. anyways, that's, that's the majority of the game from here is just swinging through the city, gorgeous, but it's also a pretty fun game and it looks great on PS4 pro compared to PS five. I haven't gotten my hands on one yet. I don't think very many people have, and I'm not planning to anytime soon because this is like running so well.
Anyways, the animations. So when you're like, the reason I mentioned it is because I love it. Character animation. And as you're swinging through the city, there's this. Set of, of animations that can play when you shoot and swing and, let go of this swing and like go into the next one.
And they all seamlessly move together. And I spent, I've spent probably a half an hour, just not even watching where I'm going, just looking at miles as Spider-Man the, the poses and the silhouettes and the, just the expressiveness and the, and the shapes that they've animated in. It's just fucking gorgeous.
