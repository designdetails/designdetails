## Designer or Developer?

**Brian:** Well, Marshall, it's a beautiful day outside. Sun is shining. Weather's clear. 150,000 people just got infected with COVID-19 and democracy is crumbling at our very fingertips. So how's your Sunday? 
Welcome to episode 373 of the Design Details podcast. I'm Brian Lovin.

**Marshall:** And I'm Marshall Bock. Welcome back for another episode! Brian, we got a palindrome episode this time, 373.

**Brian:** Love to see them, very rare, you know?

**Marshall:** Yeah. Not that rare, but yeah.

**Brian:** Well, I mean the next one will be

**Marshall and Brian:** 10 episodes.

**Brian:** Yeah. That's like once a quarter, once every couple and a half months. Anyways, special moment. We got a packed outline. So let's just jump right into it right off the bat. Huge shout out to our new very important pixels this week.
We have got some fun pronunciations coming up. Here we go. First one, huge shout out to Jordan Isip. Next one, I was challenged to pronounce this correctly. I'm going to do my best here. This next one, a big shout out to Matej Hrescak, Matej and I are buddies, but I realized I've never said his last name out loud. So in my head it was always hreshack, but then I googled it and I think it's Hrescak, anyways thanks Matej. Huge shout out to Fabiano Souza, Darren Soulsby, Priscilla, Oscar Linger, Greg Corby and this one's going to be fun Tamara Didenko. I think I got the last name. This one was fun because Tamara reached out and said it's like tomorrow, but with A's. And so I was like Tamara, and then I was like, Oh it's like saying tomorrow, but southern.

**Marshall:** Tamara. 

**Brian:** And then I Googled the last name. I think it said Didenko, but anyways, everyone y'all are awesome. Hope we got pronunciation somewhat close, but thanks for supporting the show.

**Marshall:** Amazing. Thanks everybody.

**Brian:** And with that let's get right into the sidebar. So Marshall, as is tradition we're always going to be a few days late on these, but we had an Apple event last week.
So, before we even jump into like a mini recap, I wanted to point out that the LayoutFM crew Rafa and Kevin, they also did a recap of this event and it was very good. So if y'all want to go listen to the most recent Layout.fm, I would recommend it. But of course, we're going to have our own little spin.
So Marshall, maybe we can start with order of operations here, new Mac mini first impressions.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Have you ever owned a mini?

**Brian:** No, but every time I see one, there's something about it that is like magical to me. Like seeing that device and recognizing the power it has inside of it, the size, the form factor. It's just like a chunk of aluminum that can do really cool shit. So I've never had one, but I've always wanted one.
Does that make sense?

**Marshall:** Yeah, well I've had two and they're hunks of shit. I don't know if that's everybody's experience with it, but I 

**Brian:** That's so disappointing to hear.

**Marshall:** I know, well, maybe with the new processor, it'll be better, but like I had a mini that I had to retire because it died when I tried to update it to Catalina and even then before it died, I would start it up and walk away. You remember the days back when we had computers where you'd hit the power button, and then you just like, go do something else for 5 to 10 minutes and come back and to be started up. That's how my Mac mini was. And I had almost nothing installed on it. It was just my Homebridge hub.
Right. It basically just ran a terminal window 24/7 and that's it. And boy oh boy, it was not performed. So I too have been tempted by the siren call of the Mac mini, but my past experiences have made me think that maybe it's not the best idea. However, at 700 bucks, I mean for a desktop computer, that's like better than a lot of the lower end laptops, Apple MacBooks you can buy, I don't know. Maybe it is a good deal. We'll have to see how the M1 performs. If it is good and it's sufficient to do that thing, maybe I will do it because I'm editing this podcast on a six year old MacBook pro like the one of the last unibody models.
And, I need a new computer, Brian. So, I've been holding that for the 16 inch, but yeah.

**Brian:** Realistically, we should figure out how to get you a Mac pro right.

**Marshall:** I mean, yeah.

**Brian:** Except, it wouldn't even fit like that. That's the thing that's so appealing about the mini is like the M1 chip based on everything that we're told is actually performing better than the Mac pro in certain benchmarks.
So if you can get something close to that tier of performance in something that is this small. That's compelling. Cause if you get that big tower Mac pro, like where the fuck are you going to put that, you have your PC under the same desk. It's just like a lot of space, but man, this little tiny thing.
They did show in all the videos, you know, there, they were using a Mac mini to power, the 6K XDR.
So that's saying something.

**Marshall:** I mean, Yeah. If it can do what they say it can do, plus like it's plugged into power, right. It's not running off of a battery, which means it can have a higher throughput.  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. I'll sit back, I'll wait for the YouTube reviews and see what people say.
If it's good, maybe I'll spring for it.

**Brian:** Okay. Well then how about the next announcement, the new MacBook Air. Have you ever had an Air?

**Marshall:** No, I've never had an Air, but they've always appealed to me, the whole Manila envelop thing.

**Brian:** Oh my god! me too, man.

**Marshall:** It's so like, I've held an Air before and been completely blown away by the fact that it's so light and small, it doesn't feel like it should be a computer.

**Brian:** So my most of my family has Airs and same thing, they are incredibly tiny and I'm just looking at the page now, and it says 18 hours of battery life. I just, my brain can't wrap my head around that. Like, that's a number that we will take for granted someday, but in the moment is unreal. Like, you know how every time you get on an airplane with a MacBook Pro today, you're like, well, I'll probably be able to use this for the first half of the flight. Like imagine just never having to worry about that.

**Marshall:** Or a first thing I do when I get on a long flight is, I bend over and I look between the seats to see if there's an actual, like three-prong plug that I can use. And if not, I'm sad for the next eight hours.

**Brian:** Exactly. The early benchmarks are also showing that this is more powerful than any current MacBook in certain benchmarks, not every benchmark, but like even the 16 inch MacBook Pro, this is outperforming in certain processes, which is fucking insane. 

**Marshall:** Well, speaking of the battery life thing that you mentioned, did you notice how they framed it? So a lot of the things they framed were in percentages, right? or a multiplier, right? 2x, 3x, 4x. But with the battery life, they referred to it in discrete numbers, right? so they instead of saying, we increased it by 50%, they said we added another six hours. And I thought that was really interesting just from like a marketing standpoint of like, 50% more doesn't sound like a whole lot more, but six hours more actually does make a difference, I thought that was interesting how they chose, which framing to choose of like, is this a percentage?
Is it a multiplier? Is it like a flat number?

**Brian:** I feel like this event went so hard on specs. That don't mean anything.

**Marshall:** Well, I mean their graphs didn't have any numbers on them, so there's that too.

**Brian:** But like even, what you were saying, like everything was two acts. I'm just looking at the landing page. Now it's like CPU speeds up to 3.5x faster, GPU speeds 5x, faster neural engine 9x faster. I mean, it just begs the question, faster than what? and like in the presentation they were talking about faster than like 98% of consumer grade PCs or something.
It's like, what the fuck are you talking about?

**Marshall:** Yeah. It's like, what is that? What's that model? Is it Lenovo? Is it some piece of shit? 

**Brian:** It's like saying I am the highest paid designer living on Grove street. That's over six feet tall with green eyes and, uses a 15 inch MacBook. It's like, okay. Maybe, but that's so oddly specific that it's not even a metric,
right.

**Marshall:** Well, that's too specific. They were just so general. They're like, here's a graph that has no numbers on either axis with a curve and then here's a colorful curve. And that colorful curve is a better curve than the gray curve, believe us, right?

**Brian:** Okay, so it's both right? Cause they did this like really weird specific comparison to other computers in this class range or like in this price range, it's like, Oh okay sure, but like what about all computers? And then yeah, the other side is this super general like what are we comparing to? Faster than what?

**Marshall:** Hmmhmm, previous generation of this particular model? Like that's what I assume. Right, when they say the Mac mini is two times faster, okay then I assume the previous Mac mini. 

**Brian:** Here's maybe like a good gut check. If you just scroll down to the very bottom of the MacBook Air page, there are 23 footnotes. Like little asterisks basically. Yeah, the fine print. There's 23 of them. I don't know, is this normal? Let's see the MacBook Pro, has 24. The iPhone 12 Pro only has nine.

**Marshall:** Only. What are they saying? Is it like legal stuff or

**Brian:** No, cause like if you scroll through the MacBook Air marketing page, there's those little, superscript one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. They're just, Daughtered all over the place. They're in every paragraph. There's like a footnote. Like up to 5x faster graphics*, 6 more hours of free charge*.
It's like every single thing where they talk about performance has an asterisk and you have to go down and read.

**Marshall:** So it's full page of footnotes at the bottom. Yeah. So it's like testing conducted by these people using this stuff. Okay, so here's where all the specificity is, *testing conducted by Apple in October 2020 using pre-production MacBook Air systems with Apple M1 chip and 8-core GPU, as well as production blah blah blah.*
Like, yeah. I mean, well, this is like the FDA type of shit, right? Where if you're going to make a claim, you have to be specific about the claim, but you don't want to be that specific in the actual text. So they let you get away with doing a footnote as long as it's on the same page.

**Brian:** It's so hard for them because the new chip is incredible. It's amazing. What it's going to unlock, how fast it's going to make our computers, the battery life it unlocks, just the integrated nature of it, across all the processes. Like what is that gonna allow us to do with our computers?
It's so cool, but it's so hard to talk about that in a way that actually resonates with consumers and it's getting to the point, like they will hit this probably in the next generation, which is where we are today with iPhones, where they say like the neural engine is twice as fast. Everyone's like, yeah, but the one I have right now is so fast, I've never even considered it or thought about it.
And it's a metric that doesn't even register in my brain as something that could be faster. We'll talk about some of the second, but like we both got the new phones doesn't feel faster, but on the marketing page, it's like certain things are 50% faster and we're just past the point where any of that's noticeable. 

**Marshall:** Yep. 

**Brian:** So how do you market a new chip where it's all about, faster, faster, faster.

**Marshall:** Okay, so what do you think are the things that we actually care about? Right. Like, battery life? 

**Brian:** I would say battery life, screen quality, my God, the fact they haven't upgraded the webcams past 720p is a travesty. I'll tell you what, I'm on a maxed out 15 inch MacBook Pro 2018. And my computer grinds to a halt when I power to external monitors. And I screen share with Figma running, which is something that I do multiple times, every single day. And so I'm constantly unplugging one monitor, quitting out of Figma, like screen-sharing only a certain app. Like there's so many things that I have to do to just make it perform.

**Marshall:** I have a fan pointed directly at my computer on the hotter days to keep it from overheating and giving me a kernel task thing, and also I only have one monitor plugged in, but if I'm in a video call, I turned my video off, so my computer doesn't overheat.

**Brian:** Yeah. I mean, we have our videos off for this Skype call right now for that reason. Yeah. So that's like, that's my wishlist. Like I want to get to the point where I never have to think about that, right? It just does. And it seems like we're on the path. You know, we could talk about the MacBook Pro, but I don't think there's anything really extra to say there except.
Maybe how hilariously similar the specs are between the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro or sorry, the new 13 inch MacBook Pro. So maybe, we could recap this segment, be like, are you going to get one?

**Marshall:** I'll wait until the 16 inch, but at the same time like you said, they haven't changed very much. Like nothing has changed on the outside, right? I assumed with this change on the inside, obviously they're stretching it out because they can and they got, you know, they're thinking years and years ahead, like this is just the first step on that, but like I wanted a new outfit on this new heart. But it's just a new heart. It's a heart transplant in the current attire.
 
 **Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. I think we'll probably wait like this is one of the first gen things that it seems inevitable that there's just going to be kinks they have to iron out and also the next gen they'll maybe have some breathing room to be like, okay, processors work. Now we can upgrade the webcam.

**Marshall:** Once the novelty of the M1 chip dies down, they'll release the M2 and probably pretty soon after that or right alongside it, they'll do a refresh of the actual hardware design.

**Brian:** Yeah. Or maybe there's even something coming like the M1 acts or M2 acts or something like performance pro version of the chip, who knows. 

**Marshall:** Well, let's talk about iPhones. You said, you got Pro Max.

**Brian:** yeah, I thought we could round out the sidebar with first impressions since we both got new phones. So I tweeted this, I went from the 11 Pro Max to 12 Pro Max, and it feels worse. I really grew to appreciate the 11. Physical industrial design, like the tapered glass, the really nice matte finish on the back glass was really nice to touch.
It felt really premium the way the glass sort of folded into the side rails. And now that they've gone flat rails, I was talking about this on Twitter with Sebastian de With, like I know in my brain that it is stainless steel, but it feels like plastic. It feels a little bit cheaper. It's so hard to describe, but I think I don't like it as much on the industrial design side.
I like the screen is a little bit bigger. The flat edges make it a little harder to hold with one hand, but I have fairly large hands, so not a deal breaker for me. Otherwise it's basically exactly the same. I went around and took a few photos today, but you know, from every review video, it's basically like, yeah the photo quality is more or less going to be the same.
You get a few benefits with shorter exposures on, night mode shots, because you have the actual physical moving stabilizer on the sensor. But you know, this feels like the most incremental of incremental upgrades I've experienced with an iPhone in any generation. So.

**Marshall:** Wow. Well, I lived through the previous 11 versions of the phone, it seems like there's a lot of repetition there. Anyways, well I went the other direction, I think have the opposite opinion of you on all of these things with the Mini. So it's different, right? it has the glass back, the shiny glass back and the matte rail around the outside.
And that rail doesn't feel like plastic. It feels like coated aluminum or stainless steel or whatever it feels, but it feels like metal. And the glass back is sticky in a way, that the kind of a matte finish on the other one was like, I would drop it all the time. Yeah. So the combination of a smaller phone plus the flat rails on the side, which make it easier for me to hold it and the glass back, like I can basically hold this thing vertical.
I can hold it like five degrees off of noon, with no case on it, just with the stickiness of my fingers. And it doesn't slide out of my hand, which is amazing. I haven't had this in years, so I'm very happy about that. The size is great. I can reach every corner except the top left, but the only thing that's ever up there that I would want to tap is a back button.
And I can reach the left side to edge swipe now. I don't have to have my keyboard crammed into the right side of the screen so that I can reach the whole thing. It's great, man. I love it. The only problem I've had, and I think this is, I just have a lemon phone potentially is I'm getting weird, like soft resets.
It'll go to the black screen with a spinner. and then when it comes back, I'm missing some icons. So I think I might've got bad hardware, but as far as like way it's supposed to be when it's working right. I love it, man. It's perfect. It's like the perfect phone from my tiny little boy hands.
I think so I got the 64, I just got it as a test device. But I've been using it as a daily driver for the last, like 24 hours. And I really wish I had gotten 128 or 256 because I can't fit all of my stuff on here. I had to like get rid of a lot of music and, audio books and photos and stuff, or at least not have them onboard. Yeah, I would. Yeah. Fits in my pocket. I don't have to struggle to get it into my pocket. Like it's nice, man. I feel like this is, I tweeted this. I said, lose the notch and reduce the bezels by one or two millimeters. And this phone is perfect for me.

**Brian:** Yeah. Well, my reply was, how about battery life?

**Marshall:** Yeah, I haven't run into that yet. I have been using it a lot more than I normally use my phone because I've been setting everything back up, going into every app and re-signing in which is not a fun process at all. But, I've been having fine battery life. Like I've been sitting using it for the last, like four or five hours and I'm still almost full battery.
So, but you know, this won't be a problem until, COVID is not an issue anymore because I spend 20 hours a day sitting at a desk with a charger right in front of me. Like I don't need, you know, my phone is at a hundred percent, most of the time, which is probably not good for the battery, but yeah. 

**Brian:** Oh man. Okay. Well, I'm going to have to maybe figure out how to get a test device or I don't know. I like big screened phones, but changes nice at times.

**Marshall:** I went back and used my pro. So I have an 11 Pro Max and I went back and use it after getting used to this screen size, which if you just handed me a phone and said, Hey, this is an iPhone, this is a standard iPhone. You handed me the Mini I'd be like, yeah that's the size of an iPhone should be.
I picked it, the Max, it is huge. It's like a tablet, man. I was like, there's so many pixels. I don't think I need that much fun. 

**Brian:** Ah, that's exactly what I love about it. It's very pretty, I love that, that big screen feeling, but I understand why people don't. So.

**Marshall:** I think, the resolution on the Mini is strange. So I was looking this up and I need to take some screenshots and figure it out. But the screen is a 1080 width, which at 3x, it goes down to 360, right. So I was like, Oh, sweet. We're going to have a logical screen width, on our iPhones to design for finally.
But in doing a little bit of research, it looks like it's actually rendering 375 split across that 1080 at 3x. Yeah, it's doing some weird, like the, the physical dimensions of the pixels of the screen do not map one-to-one with the logical size, right. It's actually the 375 by 812, just shrunk down. So I don't know, but I haven't noticed any weird artifacting or antialiasing, so hasn't been a problem.

**Brian:** The math there hurts my brain. But if you want to hear just insane numbers to compare that to the new iPhone is 428 by 926. Like holy shit. That's so big.

**Marshall:** I mean, the screens are getting so dense now as far as pixels go, that it kind of doesn't matter anymore. Like, it's sad to say, but we're kind of getting to a point where pixel hinting doesn't matter on these devices at all. You know, we still have to deal with it on web. And, you know, we can't assume that people have retina screens on their laptops, but we're nearing a day where we won't really have to care so much about pixel hinting and that will open up SVGs or PDFs or whatever for a lot of iconography that today is, very manually hinted.

**Brian:** The future is bright. We are slowly marching our way.

**Marshall:** I like the manual hinting though. That's part of my OCD, Brian.

**Brian:** Yeah. But when you don't have to do it, it's going to be amazing.

**Marshall:** It's cathartic now. I like it. It's like solving a puzzle, you know? Anyways.

**Brian:** All right. Well, this has been the longest sidebar ever. So, maybe tweet at us, let us know what you thought. New Macs, are you going to get one? Why, why not? and then if you've got a new iPhone, hit us up with your first impressions on Twitter at DesignDetailsFM. If you didn't know we are listener supported podcast, which means that listeners like you hearing these words, right this moment actually support the show and make it possible for us to records every single week, you can support us on Patreon by going to patreon.com/designdetails. And for just a dollar a month, you'll get access to a new supporter only segment of the show called the Sidebar. And the sidebar is basically a second half of the episode.
We usually do an extra cool thing or extra listener question or share a design tip or trick or a new app we're loving. In today's episode, we did it a whole recap of the most recent Apple event talking about the new M1 chips and the new Macs. And we give our first impressions of the new iPhones.
Marshall, I both upgraded to the twelves, but on different ends of the spectrum. So if you want to hear our recap and first impressions of the new phones. Go to patreon.com/designdetails. And for just a dollar a month, you could start supporting us today. You'll get access to the whole backlog of sidebars and all sidebars going forward.So thank you to everyone who supported the show, that's patreon.com/designdetails. 
All right, tiny bit of follow-up Marshall. So last week we recorded a very fun episode called *Saving people from themselves*, where we had a nice brainstorm and talked about different design patterns that you can use to help people from making catastrophic mistakes.
And I loved that episode. I love these like list kind of episodes. And, you know, I think we mentioned it in the moment, like, ah, this should probably be a blog post. Well, it is now a blog post. I went ahead and just basically took our notes, added some paragraphs, took some screenshots and put it up on my website, with credits to the show and to you and to Divya Tak, who proposed the question on Twitter.
So if anyone wants to read this, read a sort of articulation of last week's episode, that's on my personal website at brianlovin.com

**Marshall:** Cool.
Let us do it. We got a listener question this week. Brian, you want me to read it?  All right. This listener question comes from listener *dluft* on our GitHub repository, he says, *I am a graphic designer who wants to grow in his career.
I want to change my job to either product design or development (unsure if front or backend.) How should I decide which path to go down?* And then it gives a little bit of extra info, he's 25, lives in New York. He has redesigned a couple of websites and designed landing pages at work. And he's been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through online courses.
He has a BFA in illustration, but pivoted to graphic design and has yet to try a traditional design thinking UX project. Okay. So that's the setup, Brian. Then he has some questions that make him hesitate about transferring over to these things.
So, I guess we can go through these questions one at a time and yeah, let's get started.

**Brian:** So before we even start on the questions though, I kind of just want to have an opening monologue here. 

**Marshall:** Okay. 

**Brian:** It's the way I read this question. It felt a little bit to me, like this person hasn't even figured out what they like doing yet. Because the difference between product design and development. And then within development being unsure about front-end or back-end like these are night and day kinds of things. 
And so where I wanted to start is. Maybe this isn't necessarily a path that you have to commit to and go down, but rather you should take a few steps down each path, explore around a little bit, try them all, have fun, figuring out what are the things that you wake up excited to do more of.
And for some people that's the backend because they love the beauty of just the pure code elements. Some people love the front-end being able to actually bring something to life. And some people just love the product design, the more generalists, like how do we actually make product successful and deliver value to customers and solve their problems and talk to people. And, you know, all of the, sub work that goes into that. But I would try them all. And I would say don't commit to something that you haven't even figured out if you like. So

**Marshall:** Absolutely. Yeah, this is how I know I'm in the right position is because I wake up every morning excited to do my job. Yeah. 

**Brian:** Yes, that's awesome. Okay. Now it's time. Let's go through each of these questions. Cause I think these questions are good and it might help, coloring the edges a little bit.  All right. First one, says *As a product designer, is it uncomfortable that developers earn a higher salary?*

**Marshall:** Yeah, uncomfortable. Well, first off we should say, this is true developers in general, earn a higher salary than a designer. All other things being equal. Do you agree?

**Brian:** I agree. It is true. I kind of wanted to asterisk it and be like, there are still opportunities in design to make lots of money. Like when you get into the range where it just doesn't matter anymore, like you can be a designer at the upper level earning as much as many, many kinds of developers and the only people who might be further ahead of you are like developers at the exact same level or slightly ahead. Right. Like it's possible to be totally comfortable doing both.

**Marshall:** Yes, it is. Yeah. We make less, we still make a lot. You know, not worth complaining about it. So is it uncomfortable? Not really. And I think part of the reason for that is, engineers have to deal with a lot of bullshit that we don't have to deal with. Our jobs are a lot more fun than developers jobs in general, do you agree?

**Brian:** Well, I mean, that's us, right? Like, this is what's fun for us. And this is going back to the first point is like, whatever is fun for you. The money will be this, like it will become the side effect of just getting up and doing the thing that's fun every day.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Maybe the things that I think are not fun, bullshit that I've mentioned, like maybe those are fun for you, but the idea of thinking about handoffs and, losing connectivity and all the different edge cases of like things that could go wrong and code. Ah, I'll just design dialogs to deal with what it looks like when those bad things happen. I don't want to have to iron out actually making them work. That's a lot of not fun stuff to do in my opinion. Right. Like, but maybe that is fun for you in which case, like, that's the thing you should pursue, but yeah. 

**Brian:** I, yeah, same. Same for me. So next question *Can a product designer be taken seriously as a founder?*

**Marshall:** That's a good question. And I think there are a couple really good examples of founding designers. One being, Airbnb and the other being YouTube, the place where I work. So yeah, it happens. I mean, I think it's rare that it's just a design founder. Usually it's more than that. Maybe Brian, you could talk about supplementary help.

**Brian:** Yeah, I mean, I think. A lot of startups want to have some version of the Trifacta, which would be like a combination of engineering skills, design skills, and some sort of like business or product skills, that's where you get into unicorn territory. If someone can do all three of those things.
But generally, yeah, like it depends on the startup as well. Like, certain kinds of companies lend themselves more to being really friendly, or needing early design founder. Whereas if you're doing something in machine learning or artificial intelligence or neural networks or cryptocurrency, like, I dunno, maybe the design is that comes later, so depending on the thing.
Yeah, absolutely. I would also add like, just as a sort of proxy to understand this, there are venture capital and seed and angel investors that invest specifically in design founders. Like there is a market for venture capitalists who want design founders, which tells you that there's a class of people out there that find design founders be really valuable and worth investing in because they believe it can add, build a higher chance of success for that company.
So a few examples would be Designer Fund, Combine and Form Capital. I don't think any of them are exclusive to design founders, but they certainly market themselves to be designed founder friendly.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I think we live in a day and age now where no one takes design for granted anymore. It's an integral part of any product that you build because we're all spoiled by good design now.
 
 **Brian:** All right. *Do founding designers receive fair equity in startups?* that is a very much an it depends question. I think I just said yes, totally possible. Like design founders can totally receive the correct amount of equity in a company, depending on when they join the risk that they're taking, the responsibility they play in the formation of the company, the impact of design on the outcome for that company. and I would say, you know, like what you were just saying, Marshall, it's become more and more a given fact that design plays a role helping people decide what products they want to use, where they're going to spend their money and so more startups are realizing that and giving equity to recognize that.
Okay, next question. *Is it hard to go from being a product designer to being a developer or vice versa?*

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is a really good question. And you probably have a better chance of explaining it than I do, but yeah.

**Brian:** I would say it makes it easier. Like, if you can do one of the skills. Because we are building software and software requires all of these things to come together into a single thing that gets shipped. If you can do multiple roles or you at least have context across multiple roles, it makes it way easier to switch between the two.
Like if you know how an iPhone app gets built. You're going to have a way more informed process when you are designing an iPhone app. And actually, you know, this reminded me, it gets back into like, I think there is a false dichotomy here about like, being a product designer or being a developer because it's not always the case that you have to choose between these two things.
There is a hybrid path that is totally viable and that's called a UX engineer and this role exists at many companies. They work usually across the entire stack, probably slightly more weighted to the front-end. Maybe slightly more towards like prototyping, but certainly in the weeds with design and figuring out great user experiences, but just having the skills and technical competency to actually build the thing and prototype it out. So.

**Marshall:** Yep. I've worked very closely with the UX engineers who came from both the engineer side and from the UX side and yeah, it's the sign of someone who cares as much about design as they do the code.

**Brian:** Yeah. All right. Final question *Is product design, a satisfying career?* 

**Marshall:** Yes sir. Yeah. Yeah. Personal opinion only, but boy, oh boy, I love my job, Brian. It's very satisfying. And you know, specifically that word of like, yeah, it's satisfying. It's gratifying. I feel like I'm doing something somewhat meaningful, like the chance to be responsible for at least a part of something that millions or even billions of people see and use on a regular basis is really cool.
Like that's super satisfying in my opinion.

**Brian:** I agree. I find it. It just sits at this place where there are always new problems to solve. You're never done. It's never finished. If you ever feel like you're stagnating or not growing, it's because you're not looking hard enough for the opportunities to grow and challenge yourself and do better and be better at anything that a product design role requires, that could be everything from the pixel craft to prototyping, to user research, to product development and strategy.
Like there's just so many things that you can really flex that. And maybe even like subspecialize within this broader umbrella of product design, it's just like this huge opportunity pool that you can swim in forever. And so that for me is really exciting. And anytime I do feel like I'm getting bored, I'm like, Oh, okay, don't get bored, I just got to try something else.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. Unlike other creative fields where there's a clear end to the work. When you work on a product, it never ends unless you get shut down or run out of money, but like assuming people keep using your product, there's always more stuff to do. There's always more polished to add and more ways to grow.
 Cool. Well, hopefully that answered your question dluft. 

**Brian:** Yeah, hopefully that was a useful answer. And we got into all those bullet points. If anyone else has questions about this, please feel free to tweet at us DesignDetailsFM or you can open an issue on our GitHub repo at github.com/designdetails/designdetails.

**Marshall:** slash designdetails slash designdetails slash wait, when do I stop? It's like banana B a N a N a. When do I stop? 
Cool. Well, let's do some cool things, Brian. Would you like me to go first? Okay. I have a bit of a dual part cool thing this week, and I'm going back to my safe space of YouTube videos and video games.
This is a lot of overlap here, Brian. So this one, I think I've mentioned it before, but I watch a lot of indie game developer, like devlogs on YouTube and it's really cool cause basically anybody can make a game today. Like, as long as you can code and you have a little bit of art talent you can make a game, there's a lot of really cool platforms out there that do a lot of the work for you.
But I'm always impressed by people who kind of roll their own thing and at the same time, document it and share it with everybody else. So one of the series that I stumbled upon recently has just gotten started, but the videos are doing very, very well. I think he's only made three videos, but he's already got like 3000 subscribers after three videos, which is pretty impressive.
The guy's name is Robert Thomson. Not to be confused with one of my colleagues at YouTube, Robert Thompson. He's a Thompson. This is just a Thomson. Anyways. He's making this game and, it's very much movement-based. So if you ever played a 3D Mario game, the move set that's available for Mario there, from everything like triple jumping and long jumping to like ground pounding and like wall jumping, all that stuff.
Right. He's really leveraging a lot of those existing types of movement patterns that we expect from a 3D platform. But he's adding in a bunch of other stuff and making this really movement heavy game. At the same time, he's a great character animator and modeler. And so the style that he's chosen for this game is inspired by a subreddit that I didn't know it existed.
This is the other half of the cool thing, which is called *Mobile Frame Zero*, which is a subreddit composed entirely of pictures of tiny, tiny little robots made out of little pieces of Lego or whatever, like these little Mex, but they're all real-world tiny. So it's this cool, chunky, cute aesthetic.
And that's the aesthetic he's bringing to the game. And like I said, at the same time, he's a really great character animator. So all of these different movement actions, he has really expressive animation, going in and out of them and there's cool little idols and stuff. And talks through every single step of this thing, as he's going along and, and it's really, there's some memes and stuff, which makes the videos more fun to watch too.
But in general, I've been really enjoying it. It's just getting started too and there's a ton of other ones out there. If you're into this type of thing.

**Brian:** This is very cool. I'm just kind of, as you're talking, I'm playing a video in the background. It's very pretty. Like expressive, I guess maybe not pretty, it feels very prototype, but the jump animations, wow. Yeah, this is cool.

**Marshall:** And the thing I like about this one particularly is he's getting into that fun kind of polished stuff. Cause that's the fun part for him super early. Normally it's just like, you know, gray squares and blocks and everything is just like, enjoy art until the later stages, when you do the Polish, he's kind of polishing as he goes along.
So he's basically putting in final animations very, very early so that he can get the feel. Right, 

**Brian:** Mm, this is nice. Yeah. Okay, cool.

**Marshall:** Enjoy MFZ Mobile Frame Zero and Robert Thomson.

**Brian:** Links in the show notes. Awesome. Cool thing. Well, my cool thing this week is an app, which is a new, I think they came out of beta two weeks ago and it's called Raycast, Raycast.com. And here's how I would describe this. This is like Alfred, but for developers. So instead of interfacing exclusively with your file system and applications on your computer, you get the same kind of interface, spotlight type interface, but you are interfacing with GitHub or JIRA or whatever your issue tracker is.
And, it is very pretty. The interactions are nice. The website is great, but the app itself is a great too, there's some really cool patterns that they found, for taking a spotlight, like interface and giving it some hierarchy. Cause you can sort of traverse down through like child views, you know, say like, yeah.
Yeah. So the visual design, the interaction design is cool. And, you know, if anyone's interested in poking at that, I would recommend giving this a download. I think it's free. Even the website is worth taking a peek at, it's really nice.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Very pretty. Yeah. This it is just integrating with APIs because it looks like you can like create a new pull request or something straight from this.

**Brian:** It's all. Yeah. You basically log in with, GitHub and then they are putting interface on top of the GitHub API.
 
**Marshall:** Yeah. You even got to dues and stuff in here. This is rad.

**Brian:** Yeah. Cool things all around. Well, let's wrap. This has been episode 373 of the Design Details podcast.
