## Reconsidering Consistency

**Brian:**  that the first ears are hearing these sweet, sweet wave forms. It will be December of 2020, which means you're on vacation, right?

**Marshall:** Oh, uh, if it's the 11th or the 12th, then yes.

**Brian:** how about this still alarming? It is December. Wow. Where did this year ago? Am I right?
  Welcome to episode 375, the iPhone 10 size episode of design

**Marshall:** Oh, wow.

**Brian:** What was the first three 75

**Marshall:** I think it was probably the six, I think. Boy. Good, good stretch. 

**Brian:** this is, this is a round number for people who have ever designed for iOS. How about

**Marshall:** Yeah. Who are you?

**Brian:** Oh, I'm Brian Levin.

**Marshall:** Marshall or another episode? Yeah. At three 75 Goodwill. I was like, yeah, this isn't nice. Kind of like round number, but yeah, three 75. That's every number kind of has this extra meaning when you work in numbers all day and yeah, three 75 just stands out as, yeah.
Oh, yep.

**Brian:** Here's the thing that I've finally just accepted about Apple. Cause I always was annoyed about their use of odd numbers. And the reason is that they want a perfect center. Like they want a pixel in the center of everything, which is why a lot of their, icons are 19 or 17. Yeah. They, they want. Uh, one pixel center and then an even number on either side.
I mean, it must be otherwise, like, why do they keep doing this? And so anyways, that's why three 75 was always so frustrating, but you had to like really come up with a mental framework, be like, all right. Here's how I design around 75. I like work in from the edges and don't look for, I don't go center out.

**Marshall:** Yeah. How do you, how do you center, do you, do you go half a pixel to the right or half a pixel to the left? Which, which side do you fall? On 

**Brian:** anyways, I phones, uh, now, now we're up to work four 28 or something on the pro max, some huge. So at least it's even,

**Marshall:** man. Now I want to talk about that center icon. Cause like they don't even have one point icon width, right? Like the, the, the stroke on all of their icons is two points or a point and a half. Right.

**Brian:** yeah. I mean, at dub last January or whenever the last dub dub was, they came out with all these really nice videos of all the design changes for iOS. And I think I've watched the, SF symbols and apostrophe, and there were so many, many moments in that video that I was just screenshotting and sending to you.
I'm like, what the fuck is going on with these measurements? But ultimately it came down to that. Yeah. They had to have some system for why it's always. anyways, we got an episode. Let's get into it. first of all, we have some new, very important pixels this week.

**Marshall:** boil points. Who we, Brian. Oh

**Brian:** Boy. Oh boy. What happened?

**Marshall:** I don't know, but I'm happy about it. It's so cool.

**Brian:** This is really cool. Y'all came through. We had a big week. Uh, so we're gonna, list off some names here. Um, in Brian's favorite, weekly segment called, uh, Brian fucks up the way your name is pronounced. I'm so sorry.

**Marshall:** It's my favorite weekly installment. And Brian butches, your name?

**Brian:** All right. Huge shout outs to, uh, sheesh, Nagy, Alyssa Jong Tiffany. See you Alexandra stress sec.
Richard Pico, Sam LND. Camille L'Affaire Jackie car. Joaquin Coon, Cal Fabian Valkenburgh. Ooh, that's cool. The LAN Lazano.
rubbing Chen Ryan Hassan, Jesse box Thomas, Bishop Oscar Newman, and David bill.

**Marshall:** wow. That's a hell of a list, Brian.

**Brian:** Hell of a list.

**Marshall:** names in there too. Wow. Uh, Jesse box.

**Brian:** That's a nice, yeah. Jesse box model. More

**Marshall:** yeah. Yeah. Jesse sphere, Jesse, rectangular prism. However you want to say it. Yeah.

**Brian:** Can we speculate a little bit. I, I wish people would tweet at us cause it'd be cool for us to like, I mean, we're doing this indirectly, but we're trying to find what's the most, what's the best content. Like what do people want to hear? What gets people excited enough to support the show? Let's keep making more of that.
And so last week in the sidebar, we talked about auto layout V3, in Figma, some maybe more, just deeper crafty workflow stuff. Um, I don't know.
Yeah, something resonated. So it's a tweet at us. If there's a particular reason that this, was a big week.

**Marshall:** This one just hit

**Brian:** Well, on that note, uh, for all of our new VIPs yeah.
Let's get into probably their first sidebar this week. We have a listener question on our get hub. this one comes from Marvin. Probably fuck that name up to, Hey, Marvin, Marvin says how to start an interview podcast and continues. Hey guys, as a time listener and huge podcast fan, I've tried to hang a toe in the water myself.
For one year, I did a solo podcast. Then I quit. Now the desire to get back into the business is growing. But this time with an interview podcast, my question to the experts, what is the best way to get in? How do you find the right people and how do you conduct an exciting interview? Do you have a fixed structure or is it more like a muscle that you have to train?
I'll be very happy about a little help to get started greetings from Germany and stay healthy. Marvin, thank you, Marvin. We will stay healthy. Uh, so I thought this was a good sidebar topic, mostly because I have a strong opinion that there are not enough design podcasts. And, you know, we have an angle and our show has evolved over the years and there are several other design podcasts that have come and gone over the years, but I just still think there's so much room for more voices, more perspectives, more tones, more angles on the design industry.
it felt useful for us to spend a few minutes, maybe just sharing the way we think about it so that other people might be encouraged to go out and do the same.
 All right. So I guess we could frame all of this with, you know, Marvin asking you about an interview podcast specifically. I guess we'll frame this around design interviews.
Cause that's kind of what we know. Like it might be different if you're interviewing celebrities or I don't know, sports CEOs, something like that. Sports, folk, I don't know what you call those people.
so here here's my list of questions that you might ask yourself. It's like, what is the angle?
What are you trying to accomplish with the podcast? And so I can give an example for design details. When it first started was how do we talk to the people who are making our favorite things and how do we get inside their brains to understand. Why they make the design decisions the way they do. And so when we started, we would interview people and that kind of content kind of got sandwiched in between sort of life story.
So we would always start by like asking, you know, where are you from? How did you get here? Work history kind of thing. And then when we could get into the details, there's always like, how do you make decisions? How do you think about design? And so that was the angle. That's what we genuinely wanted. To learn about.
And so for new podcasts, I think it's important to ask yourself, like, what am I trying to extract out of the interview? Do I want it to be. A casual conversation. Do I want it to be like this really preplanned structured set of questions that I ask everybody? Does everybody get different questions?
Like what's the angle here? What's the information that you really think is important that nobody else seems to be asking these types of guests, which brings me to the second question that I ask is like, what's the tone that you want for the podcast. And so for design details, when it was an interview show, uh, we focused really on.
I dunno, it's cringey for me to go back and listen to some of our early episodes. Cause I feel like we weren't great, but we were so casual that that became the tone. The tone was, I feel like I'm listening to a conversation between two people who just met each other for the first time over a coffee or something like that.
So we rarely pre-planned questions. We would always do some light research. You know, you want to know a little bit about the person, but we never went so deep that we. Couldn't just have surprises come up, in the show. So that was our tone was definitely skewed further along the casual side.
so this would be in contrast to something where, you know, you have your pre-planned list of questions, like 60 minutes style and you have an exact format that you're going for. And it's like really serious and structured. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. so I think you should think about the tone that you're going for. then the third question that came to mind for me was like, do you want to cohost? And I think you can find successful. Examples of interview shows where it's a solo interviewer, you know, like the Joe Rogan's of the world, you know, getting into some possibly divisive territory here, but he's obviously the biggest interview podcaster in the world right now.
versus, you know, what, what you and I have done where we are both on an interview, Brendan and I both interviewed people. And I think the trade-off here is just how good you are at maintaining a conversation. Like I think a co-host in an interview format is kind of like a crutch. It's like if one person gets blocked or runs out of a line of questioning, having somebody to fill in and carry the torch is really useful.
And then you get some breathing room to think of the next thing.
And the other thing too, is like the personalities of the cohost. I find that when I listen back to Brandon I's interviews, Brynn seemed to consistently provide the comedic relief, which was really useful for adding to the tone of. How conversational the show was. He could come in with a joke and sort of lighten the mood.
We're not taking ourselves so seriously. We're trying to just connect with this person. I think Bren did that really well. And I would come in with the more serious design questions, I suppose. So angle tone, and then yeah. Format would be like, do you have a co-host like, how do you actually interview the person?
those are three things that might sort of guide you down one path or another. And then after that, I guess there's just tips. Right? So the first thing is consistency. I think for anyone who listens to podcasts seriously, They appreciate knowing the day that the show is going to come out and that it comes out at the same time.
Usually every single week, I feel like most shows kind of rally around the weekly release aside from, I don't know, daily ones like the New York times or, other things like that. But usually it's on a fairly weekly schedule. Whatever you decide. It's just gotta be consistent, like build this into people's schedule.
People know what to expect when to expect it. I think consistency as well on like length and, again, consistency on tone, consistency on content. Like all of this is really important, so that people just know what to expect. They can recommend the show with confidence to their peers. they won't recommend it.
And then somebody listens to it and hear something completely different than what you would hope they would have heard, uh, when they recommended it. So consistency across all of these dimensions, I think is important. you know, as we could probably talk about how we switched up the format and broke that consistency.
So I think it's important to not lock yourself in too much. It's okay for the show to evolve. But as you do that, bring people along for the ride, which hopefully we did. the next tip for an interview podcast, maybe they should have been versus like the interview quality is dependent on the guest. Like you, you can have the greatest personality in the world.
You can be the smartest person in the world, but no one's listening for that. They're listening to hear the conversation that you're going to have with someone that they want to learn from. So how do you get. Great guests. And there's, there's one surprisingly simple trick to get great guests on your podcast, which is to get great guests on your podcast.
And this is so frustrating for people, but it's like, if you can have a name, someone who is well known or respected in the field, come on your show. Record an early episode. That becomes the name that you include in all future cold emails to other potential guests and say, will you come on my show, this person who you probably know and respect decided that this was worth their time.
So you should as well.

**Marshall:** here's a link to their episode. Go ahead and listen to it, right?

**Brian:** Exactly. Yeah. And. To this point. I think this is where a lot of people get stuck and maybe intimidated, but I would just encourage people to remember that most people out there are pretty generous with their time. as far as like finding good guests, I think the more senior more established well-known people they're getting to the point in their career where they want to teach others, they want to share what they've learned.
And in many cases, a podcast is the most Like energy to impact ratio efficient way of doing that. Like rather than writing 50 blog posts, documenting everything, they know, they could just have a conversation for an hour get out some of the high level ideas. So I think people should feel comfortable reaching out to people.
and I think you'll discover that most people are quite generous with, their time. All right. One, I'm curious your perspective on this Marshall, cause I'm actually really torn on this. I am kind of in the camp that a shorter interview or shorter podcasts in general is the more respectful podcast format.
But I, I have the data against me, I think because the most popular podcasts in the world right now seem to be the like two, three hour interview shows. And I could go either way, like I understand why. Having a three hour conversation with Obama, for example, would be way more interesting than a 30 minute interview with Obama.
Like I get that difference, but I just can't shake this feeling that the three hour version is disrespectful to the listener. It's like, look at it all this time that you have to invest into listening to this rather than. Us having put in some work or a little more preparation to try and cut it down a little bit.

**Marshall:** Yeah, well, 

**Brian:** I don't know. Where, where do you fall on this?

**Marshall:** it depends on what's in those three hours or what's in those 30 minutes, if it's 30 minutes, that a good chunk of it is just hemming and hawing and umming and shuffling papers. And you know, it's not edited down. Well, then that sucks. But if it's three hours, that's really solid and well edited.
That's a better experience. So yeah, I mean, it's all about content, right? Like, you know, people will sit down and binge an entire series and that is the season or, you know, a bunch of episodes, but like an entire series of a show, uh, in a few days that's a huge commitment, but also at the same time, like, 10 minute videos do really well on social media.
So it's like, depending on the content and how well done it is, it's going to, attract or repel people. 

**Brian:** Yeah. So maybe this is where you could talk a little bit Marshall about the editing and production side, because pretty early on, after you joined, you took over that role. And, it would not be a lie to say that you're a perfectionist when it comes to quality of the audio, but also of the content, making sure that we're doing the best we can to ship only content that we think is interesting and engaging and funny and 

**Marshall:** I dunno, how is it going? Um, I've been enjoying it. It's like, um, Yeah, every episode is kind of a little puzzle or it's this little problem to solve and, and it's got a bunch of little problems inside of it, like, especially with our inability to speak well. and you know, the, the number of things I have to Cobbled together to like, make a coherent thought. Usually when I'm talking, it's a lot of work, but it's really satisfying on the other end when you listen to it through. And it sounds like, Oh yeah. I just spoke really well for, you know, a

**Brian:** I sounded smart. Well, what's one measurement that you started tracking kind of early. I don't know if you still do was the minutes of editing per minute of audio. 

**Marshall:** Yeah, the ratio. 

**Brian:** high. could you talk about that?

**Marshall:** yeah, it was like six to one initially, something like that. So for, for every hour it would take me six hours to edit, just to edit, that doesn't include bouncing and saving out files and all that stuff. but yeah, I've gotten it down and descript has helped a lot with this, but I've gotten it down to about three or four to one.
So, um, yeah, which is huge. I've, I've basically cut my editing time in half. And part of that is just, I've gotten better at it. part of that too, is that we've gotten better at not doing the things that made editing hard, you know? I think we're both better at ums and likes than we used to be. but what's interesting about editing is like, I'll leave some of those in there.
Right? I'll leave in ums. I'll leave in likes because that's how we talk and that's how humans talk. And when you cut that out, it starts to get a little bit robotic. So the, I think this goes more to the tone thing that you were talking about earlier of like maintaining that humanness. This is also why we include a cold open and a stinger at the end of every episode of like, Hey.
Yeah. We're just sitting around and talking and hopefully that helps with, listeners realizing that we're just people, I dunno, I think some people, especially now try to make things seem bigger than they are, but I think we've succeeded by making it feel smaller than it is. I don't know.
Does that make sense?

**Brian:** Yeah. And I think that exact point is what drew people into sort of the first phase of design details when we did interviews, which was the tone was very casual, which ended up feeling quite inviting. Like, especially since a lot of people who might have been new to design or were interested in becoming designers.
We're discovering the show, having that approachability and not immediately sort of facing a brick wall of too much jargon or at least jargon. That's not explained acronyms that aren't explained like over the years we've tried to use fewer and fewer acronyms, or if we do use jargon, we try and like, you know, explain it in line.
Yeah. So, yeah, the casual tone, I think helped, but obviously there's really highly produced, highly edited podcasts that are equally successful. But when you listen to them, your brain goes into a different place. Like when you listen to the daily from the New York times, or you listened to, cereal, you know, from nine, nine, 9% of visible. Yeah. Your brain. It's so professionally produced with the audio bumpers and like the way he introduces each segment and the tone of the voice, like your expectations are so dramatically different than a very casual conversation style interview.

**Marshall:** the ladder is a lot more achievable for a beginner for sure. Um, do you have advice on things not to ask? so you kind of mentioned earlier, don't do too much research so that you're not surprised in the middle of the interview. you know, you kind of want to not know all the answers so that you can maybe go down a, path that you hadn't planned on ahead of time. Are there questions that you intentionally don't ask because you already know the answer because the answer is usually the same between guests and it's not useful, anything like that.

**Brian:** Yeah, I think if I'm being honest, I kind of regret not doing as much research. And the reason for that is if you do good research, You can skip through a lot of the surface level stuff and get into the more interesting details of the thing. But if you have to spend 20 minutes of a conversation going through the high level, surface level stuff, you might not ever get to the interesting nuggets of why they made a particular decision.
If you're still having to focus on like, Oh, and after you worked at this place, then where did you go to work? Like, it can be a little bit boring. I think it's boring for the guests and boring also for people who might know that person. so I don't know. I think if I could do it again, I would actually do more research, 

**Marshall:** I was literally just, I was going to mention Narvar and hot ones. Those are going to be my two examples of like research can actually be a really amazing thing. Okay. Talk about it.

**Brian:** Yeah, I think there's something really fun delightful about watching an interview where the interviewer asks a question and the guest goes, Oh shit. Like how did you know that? Or I haven't thought about that in years.

**Marshall:** no
one's ever asked me that before. I don't have a rote answer to just rattle off.

**Brian:** thing for a guest to say it's no one's ever asked me that before, yeah.
And if you can get to that place, one, you have now created an entirely unique piece of content that doesn't just recycle this. Person's talking points across all of their other interviews and blog posts and conference talks and all
that kind of stuff. And. the guest is going to have a way more fun. They're more likely to recommend the show. Ideally, the guests that you've brought on is somebody that other people want to hear from. So if this person is recommending like, Hey, I was on this podcast, you should go listen to it.
Cause I talked about things I've never talked about before. you're going to grow your podcast. So that goes back to content quality. But this is a great sort of Avenue into that.
 
 **Marshall:** and I guess maybe one of the last things that goes along with consistency would be, Longevity, right? Like, be consistent about what you're doing, and then just keep doing it for a long time.
It sounds like you did it for a year before you gave up, which is a pretty long time, but usually it takes years and years. Like you should, if you want to start a podcast or you want to start a YouTube channel or whatever it happens to be expect to be unknown for two to three years before you gain any traction whatsoever.
And that's why most people don't continue to do it is because they do it for a few months. I don't see any major rise in viewership and give up. So you got to stick with it?

**Brian:** Yeah, it's the same thing as. Blogging as designing. It's like any of these things, right? It all compounds and the most interesting and substantial gains happen at the very end as the curve starts to sort of point upwards. Right.
but the very beginning is slow.

**Marshall:** That's my favorite line from a dr. Strange   

**Brian:** Yeah, I like that. I, in fact, I saw a tweet. I don't know if I'd be able to dig this up, but it was the average number of videos released on YouTube, at each sort of milestone for subscribers. And it was something crazy, like the average. Channel with a million subscribers has released over 3000 videos and that's insane, but you can see the numbers from like zero to 10, K 10 K to a hundred K, a hundred K to a million it's just volume and work and consistency and effort.
It's just very rare to have, an instant moonshot rise to the top.

**Marshall:** I feel like design details was kind of like that, right? Like you get some great interviews, some great people immediately. Y'all lucked out, I think.
And I just 

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** my horse to your wagon or wagon to your wagon. I don't know,

**Brian:** Hitched my wagon to your traveling coat.
Uh, okay. Last things. I mean, on the technical bits for like podcasts and gear and stuff, if anyone's interested, I'll just link to Brynn's post. He wrote a blog post called podcasting the basics that has info about gear and software and microphones and all that kind of stuff. So. Okay. Well I think hopefully we covered it, but, uh, Marvin, if we miss anything, you know, hit us up on Twitter, we'll do our best to respond there,  go create podcasts, everyone, and then send us links to them and we will talk about them.
That'd be great to see.

**Marshall:** of us, one of us 

**Brian:** All right. If you didn't know, we're listener supported podcast, which means that you person human being listening to the show right now. many people like you who have been enjoying the show are responsible for making it happen every single week.
And people support us directly on Patrion. And that helps us pay for all of our subscriptions hardware, software website, hosting. All of this stuff adds up and you make it possible. If you have been enjoying the show or even if this is your first week listening, we would really appreciate it. If you supported us, by going to patrion.com/design details.
Support starts for just a dollar a month. It's really approachable and accessible. And when you do subscribe, you'll get access to a supporter. Only segment of every episode called the sidebar. In this week, sidebar, we share all of our thoughts and tips and tricks and ideas for how to start a successful design podcast.
what you should do, we need more podcasts. If you want to hear our thoughts on starting a design podcast, head to patrion.com/design details and consider supporting us starts just a buck a month. And we really appreciate it. We're getting up there almost to 400 supporters making this show possible.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Thank you to everybody. Awesome.

**Brian:** Alrighty, a little bit of follow-ups. So Marshall, last week we talked about the end of the Mac era. We got a couple messages. So the first message came from Jay Sol on Patrion. he left a comment on the episode saying, so you guys talked about Apple and the ecosystem, and I mostly agree this made me think for what reasons who knows.
What about these widgets that they've adapted from Android? How limited or far reaching should their functionality be? Me personally, I struggle with Apple's clock widget. It's perfectly fine. If all you want to do is keep up with time and other places, but the clock app itself has things for stopwatch timer.
It seems like such a waste to only have the functionality that it does. I've been prototyping and alternative. I was wondering how you feel about this area.

**Marshall:** Yeah. What's interesting about Apple widgets is they don't have any interior functionality, right? Like it's basically just one big button. maybe a few different, big buttons, but like, you can't do anything inside there. There's no swiping. There's no like long pressing or anything. All of that stuff does S level things, not widget level things.
Right. So your functionality is immediately really diminished. So, I dunno, I, I assume that was intentional is like these widgets you're not supposed to spend time in, and these are just windows into the app. If you want to do stuff in the app, tap on it and go in there. Right. In the same way that like a watch notification is just like a window into that thing.
You want to do more stuff on it, either tap into it and do stuff on the watch app or
 
 **Brian:** Yeah, I think the dub dub talk about designing a great widget is useful here. We'll have a link in the show notes, but yeah, they're supposed to be more glanceable and a lot of this comes down to. Not trying to build app experiences on the home screen that are gonna use up a lot of data, use a lot of battery.
It's supposed to be like infrequently updated or updated. Just-in-time kind of information that helps you decide whether or not you need to open an app, at all. So like the weather widget, you know, helps you from ever having to open the weather app,
but I guess all of that, maybe shouldn't excuse, I don't know. It's the first year for these, right? Like iOS 14 just came out. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of evolution happening in the first party apps, as far as widget types, they support, some maybe we'll see a bunch of new clock widgets next year, and it'll become like a Apple watch style event.
Every keynote where it's. Like these are all the new first party widgets in the same way every year. It's like, these are all the new complications that you can

**Marshall:** Uh, yeah, 

**Brian:** perhaps different kinds of functionality. Like maybe you'll be able to do things like. Non data, intensive things, starting a timer or something. And you could just sort of slide on the widget. I don't know.
I could imagine that being pretty useful for people. So

**Marshall:** Yeah. We're also in this weird middle ground of like old widgets living right next to new widgets. So that kind of makes it weird.

**Brian:** that's right. Yeah. Waiting for the third parties to kind of get in line anyways. Uh, thanks for the question, Jay. Uh, we also had a tweet from Tobias garter, who, uh, said after an unexpectedly easy transition to Android from forever iPhone, I actually tried to switch to PC a year ago, not as easy, but stuck with it. to find hardware that felt good enough went for the surface laptop, but windows.
Yikes. Okay. I mean, that's the ecosystem. Lock-in and I think this is why people  don't like Apple, because it's so hard to transition. I'm actually surprised that Tobias had an easy time transitioning from Android to iPhone because that frickin iMessage garden man, like it makes it really hard to 

**Marshall:** green bubbles. Yeah. I, it took me six months to transition from being PC for life, to moving to max so I, I understand feel the pain Now I'm ambidextrous sprain.

**Brian:** you are?

**Marshall:** Oh, S fluid,

**Brian:** fluid. Yeah. 

**Marshall:** uh, AMBA. Oh, estrus. boss trust.

**Brian:** Capitalize,

**Marshall:** Thanks Tobias. Uh, and I have one little last tiny piece of a followup. I thought of another, um, saving users from themselves thing, Brian. Okay, cool. Perfect. I'm sure. I'll think of other ones. And that's what this follow-up section is for. So, um, we'll, we'll keep them coming, but yeah, I was typing the other day and I don't know if you know this or if you remember this, but when Apple first created this like onscreen keyboard instead of a physical keyboard and the first iPhone, one of the things they touted was how letters will become larger, make their tap targets larger. If they know that the. Next letters in the given word that you're typing are more or less likely, you know what I mean?
 yeah. Try it for yourself. Like tries, typing the first few letters of a known word and then tap a random letter like queue and see what it lets you do
 way off. Or maybe like tap the letter next to the letter that you would expect to be the next letter. Anyways,

**Brian:** Oh, I see. All right. That's a good one. Uh, I've got a couple others. These were actually came in from, from tweets. so Divya talk tweeted. One more thing. How in get hub, when you're trying to delete a repo, you have to go through so many hoops and it reminded me there is this pattern. Get hub, has it, if you're trying to delete a repo, but I've seen this on a lot of other services where you're trying to delete something very significant, they force you to type in the name of the thing.
Have you seen that?

**Marshall:** Oh, I have seen that. Yeah. Where's is that like on discord or something? Yeah, I've seen that before or no. It's I think it's actually on YouTube. You have to type the name of your channel to delete your channel, something like that, but

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. It's like, there's no way to accidentally miss click a button or, accidentally do this thing. You have to type a perfect character match of the name of the thing that you were deleting. There's a lot of layers there. You're acknowledging the deletion. It's avoiding accidental deletion.
So that's a great one. one came from a tweet from Havana. When, who says my favorite examples that were not mentioned in the episode, don't show me posts like this.
the context is like on a self-harm content on Tumblr feeds. You could say, I don't want to see this. Uh, another example was a prompt that asks, did you mean today or tomorrow?
If you set an alarm around midnight, and, then Havana mentioned a simplified driving mode player on audible, which maybe you know about, but it reminded me that Spotify has the same thing. If you are driving, it hides all the. Main UI and basically gives you these huge chunky play next buttons.
Right? And then that reminded me of the feature on iOS, which is, do not disturb while driving, which just the text, if you're driving and automatically turns on, do not disturb. And if someone texts you, it automatically responds to that person says, Hey, they're driving, they'll get back to you soon. Wild.
And then the last one, this tweet came from Jordan Morgan. Who has this interaction that they've built into their app, where after you drag and drop something, there's a little toast that pops up that says, you know, you dragged this thing to this thing. It's like, make sure you got it to the right place.
But that sort of reminded me of the new prompt in iOS 14, whenever you paste something, a system level toast appears from the top that says pasted. Content from the clipboard from such and such app. And it's like a privacy indicator, like, Hey, we are doing this thing in the background, you paste it. But just so you know, like this app had it.

**Marshall:** Yep. have another one,  one last one, uh, inline muted play. So if you're watching a video or something or scrolling through a feed and there's videos that play automatically having the muted by default, and you have to opt in to playing the sound that way you don't blast something on the train or whatever. 

**Brian:** That's a great one. Yeah.

**Marshall:** that saved me many a time.

**Brian:** Alrighty. Now some good follow up. Well, I'll add these into the blog posts that we have, For, in as well. all right. Main topic. Okay. This is something that has come up in the last couple of weeks that feels just right for us to sort of riff on. And basically it is the big Sur new app icon style. And here's what's happened. So big Sur has sort of created a new, consistent shape. The four icons. It wants everything to be a rounded rectangle square, and, apps are slowly evolving to match that style.
But there's people who are tweeting that they're upset that certain apps haven't yet migrated to that style. for example, uh, things actually updated their icon for big Sur, but it's not perfectly square. It's like slightly vertically rectangular. And then, you know, of course there's just apps that haven't switched over yet, which is probably most apps at this point since big Sur is so new.
And this just reminded me of how crazy town it is that like two weeks ago, people were freaking out over the new Google icons for Gmail and calendar and meat and all this stuff saying that the consistency of those was explicitly bad, because it's really hard to distinguish between the two. And I feel the same thing is happening here on big Sur, like.
This new shape is very pretty in isolation. Each individual app icons, like, Ooh, that looks really nice, but in concert, in sweet, when you have multiple of them along a row in the doc, each individual, one is harder to identify just by scanning using that sort of silhouette as a affordance of, what the thing is.
And so I thought we could talk about this. I guess we'd call it hypocrisy where people really want the consistency here in this case. But when the Google icons were updated, everyone was like, this is bad consistency. And I would almost argue that the macro has big Sur changes are bad consistency. 

**Marshall:** Okay, well, Maybe I'll give a little bit of a little background history lesson here. So, uh, you didn't remember this. And I had to make sure that I didn't dream it, but, back in Yosemite, Apple, did their first phase of this kind of icon cleanup stuff, where they reduced the number of silhouettes quote unquote allowed to three, right?
So they had a circle. A rounded kind of squat rectangle, and a tilted sharp edged rectangle. And We'll have a link in the show notes to an article detailing that, but I think it's interesting that this is actually like the second phase of their attempt to consistent ties icons and, This is more consistent, I guess, but yeah.
Okay. So let's, talk a little bit about if it's, whether it's good or not. Um, so first off I am an employee of Google. So let me just say these opinions are my own. and, uh, I'm just speaking as a, as a designer, not as designer who works at Google, but, um, yeah, what's interesting about, I think the Google icons is not so much the consistency of the shape, but the consistency of the color because, every single icon has.
Red yellow, green, and blue in it. Instead of being all red or all yellow are all green or all blue, right? Like I think that was the, one of the big things With the Google like productivity apps. So like slides was yellow now it's red, green and blue and yellow. meat was green, but now it's red, green, blue, and yellow, docs was blue, but now it's red, green, blue, and yellow sheets was green, but now it's red, green, blue, and yellow.
So it's like, Uh, at a glance, you can't see any of these. You have to use that interior silhouette of the glyph inside of the rounded rectangle to figure out what the thing is now, as opposed to just a color glance plus shape, et cetera. So, when it comes to the Apple ones, like they still have them differences within that bounds.
And it's easy to tell numbers apart from keynote, apart from pages, because. They they're actually all different colors and different shapes and everything in a way that  

**Brian:** Yeah, but I feel like, okay, so you have this problem that you have lots of applications. You, you need ways for people to distinguish what app is, what app. So you give them icons and within icons, you have all these things that you can control that will help people identify. What the icon represents, uh, you know, this is usually like, a brand logo, but in the case of something like messages, it's a chat bubble.
So you have some sort of ornament on top of it. And then yeah, you, then you have things like color and shape and size, and you have all these ways to help people distinguish between different kinds of things. And so I guess maybe one question that I would be interested to speculate on is why is it so important for these to be consistent?
Because in Google's case, they got rid of color as a differentiating element. And in big, sir, we're getting rid of shape as a differentiating element. So they both have ornament. They both have, uh, maybe some size that you can play with. And, Uh, like the metaphor, the icon that that is going on.
Right? So an M for male. but both companies have said of the list of things we can use to help icons be different from each other. We're gonna cut one of them or at least we're going to start enforcing that. One of them is 

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. It's one less or lever to pull when it comes to differentiating your glyph from others.
um, I don't know. Well, maybe we can do a little bit more history. So, um, Android used to be in the same boat, right? Like Android had a unique silhouettes for every single icon and it was wild West. You could do whatever you wanted to within these, the size of bounds. and as a result, homescreens.
Especially in that grid style looked kind of messy in my opinion. Um, sure. What the reasoning was for going to more consistent shape, but now, an Android, there are a few different shapes that are chosen by the OEM. So like Samsung or whoever HTC, they make a decision, whether they want a circle or a rounded rectangle or a scorecard, I think is the other shape that's available.
We'll have a link in the show notes to this but, yeah, it's, it's a lot more consistent when you look at a grid of things, does this translate to a horizontal row of a doc? I don't know. I think those are kind of different beasts. maybe there's some shared things between them, but I feel like,  

**Brian:** I don't know. I suppose it feels like the decision. I mean, obviously there's probably a lot of reasons for this, but one decision certainly seems to be. Aesthetics, like one just looks prettier. Um, if you, if you blur your eyes a little bit, uh, but I feel like that prettier nearness, the aesthetic upgrade is at the cost of usability, glance ability.
Scanability this kind of thing. you know, the Google example, I think really stands out. If you think about the way people actually use Google products, which. For most people who are in G suite, you're using multiple of these things. At the same time. You have Gmail open at the same time. As you have calendar open as the same time you have drive open and.
The way you differentiate those properties in your doc is, or sorry in your browser is through favicons. And if the fabric cons at a small size, all kind of look the same. Now it's really fucking hard to figure out which tab you should go to. so the way people actually use the thing seems to have gotten lost in translation with, Oh, this is pretty because it's consistent and fits with our brand.
Right. And so I'm a little worried the same thing's happening with big Sur. Like each one on their own is fucking gorgeous. I love it. the idea that like there's an itch in my brain being scratched by having the consistent shape and like sort of guideline here. But when you're actually trying to quickly find an icon in your doc or, or when you're command tabbing, if they all look the same, you have to just spend more cognitive energy, figuring out where you're going to go.

**Marshall:** well, I think there's, um, kind of a memory palace thing at play here too, of like,  uh, you don't know the main memory palaces. Oh, it's a, it's a great concept. So, backstory here is, I don't know if it's apocryphal or not, but basically back-end Roman times or some shit. I don't know. There was like a building collapse and a philosopher.
I'm getting this all fucked up, but like, there's a philosopher who was at this wedding ceremony or whatever, when the building collapsed and he was able to remember where everyone was. Sitting at the table based on their location. Well, like I was sitting here and then this person was to my left  And they were able to like recover these people from the rebel. Cause they knew where to look. Right. So, what, what this spawned was this idea of like, it's a lot easier to remember things. When they have a physical location attached to them. So this created this kind of memory system of remembering large sets of things by attaching them to known locations So for example, you could choose like your childhood home and remember a bunch of really random stuff by creating an image and placing it in a location. Of that known area. So on your front step is the first thing you want to remember.
And then when you go into the foyer, there's another thing that you want to remember there. and it's a lot easier to like, recall those things, if there's that association, does that make sense?
So, when you, when you have a grid layout, like you do on a phone, it's a lot easier to have that muscle memory of Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Top. Right. And then down one or whatever, you know, column three, row five, whatever it happens to be, you can jump to it really quick and you're not even necessarily relying on the shape or whatever.
Maybe that's an additional thing, but like this, the location becomes a new lever or a new knob. To help you identify this particular thing that you're trying to find in a doc when that's kind of changing as apps get added or removed, or depending on how many apps you actually keep in your doc, the size of that thing can grow and shrink and your muscle memory no longer becomes
 
 **Brian:** Yeah, exactly. Well, okay. So this gets to an interesting point, which is like, maybe I'm just a weird user of this because I use my doc in a weird way. Tell me if this is weird.

**Marshall:** okay.

**Brian:** I have nothing pinned there. So nothing is pinned. Things only appear in the doc when the app is

**Marshall:** Yup. Yup. Yup.

**Brian:** Alfred, or I suppose most people would use spotlight that is for launching applications. Right. 

**Marshall:** and command tab to go between them or, mission control. Yeah. 

**Brian:** So, okay. So in, in our world, the icon position will never be permanent unless you just always happened to have one app open and it 

**Marshall:** Yeah. So I'd argue it's more important to have differentiation in this use case than it would be on a phone and say, 

**Brian:** I mean, even if I just open up, I don't even know what you call this launch pad, whatever the like app grid is in Macko

**Marshall:** Oh yeah. Launch pad, I think

**Brian:** like

**Marshall:** Does anybody use that?

**Brian:** no, nobody in the history of the planet earth has ever used this, but if you open it and just kind of scroll through your app icons, just cause this is the biggest way to see them.
I would argue that the best first party icons are the ones that explicitly break the bounds of that square, because it adds another layer of scanability malignant, like automator TextEdit garage band, they all break the bounds and they're better for it as opposed to. I think, you know, numbers, keynote pages.
These I work apps. I think they took a step backwards because they took this iconic silhouette of the bar graph, sort of the podium keynote thing, and the, the page plus pen from pages. They took these iconic silhouettes and put them all inside of a white square. It's like, I have to spend more time figuring out, which is which, So, yeah, in this context, that does feel like a regression.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I think it's all about the use case or, or the environment that these things are in. Yeah, this is, this is tough. Cause like the design systems, part of me wants to have this consistency, but the user 

**Brian:** Yeah, this is where I. That tension feels like we made the wrong choice. Like we made the designers, made the choice that felt best for other designers, like other designers would see it and appreciate it. Yeah. I guess the last thing that I think is kind of interesting about, the way big Sur icons work.
And I'm really curious if we'll bring this to iOS at any point is that you can have an alpha channel. Like you can have transparency on the app icons. And so sketch did this right. Sketch kind of made the rounds on Twitter because when they showed their new app icon for the big server version, the back square sort of has these pains that represent the sidebar and the, the toolbar from the app itself.
And those are semi-transparent. So whatever the color of your wallpaper is, that'll sort of shine through and your app icon feels a little dynamic and part of the system.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, they have to have an alpha channel, right? no, we don't. Well, what goes even further as the Apple TV icons, those have layers and, and parallax and depth. will we ever get that on any of these things you could imagine it, I mean, it seems on iOS and iPad iOS.
Like the mobile systems are trying to go flatter. And I guess that makes sense. But on Mac, there seems to be a very intentional effort to keep things layered and have depth and drop shadows and everything. They even like include a drop shadow in these icons. Like you have to have a drop shadow, um, and you, and they want things to be rendered and look 3d in a way that they don't want them to look that way on iOS.
So. I wonder if we'll ever get kind of that more dimension on Mac, or if they'll
keep that relegated to just Apple TV, I wonder.

**Brian:** it's so, yeah, I don't know. Cause on Apple TV I'd argue the same problem exists. Like, you know, you have your four sort of top whatever docked icons or apps. And those ones you just memorized by position, but everything else it's really hard to scan for stuff. Like if you actually scroll down in the list of all the apps on your Apple TV, it takes a lot of work to figure out which one is which, because really have to rely on
  
  **Marshall:** I don't know. I think, I think the background color on those becomes even more important, you know, it's not just, uh, the glyph inside. Like you need that background splash of like, Oh yeah, this is Hulu. or this is podcast cause it's purple.  

**Brian:** yeah, we'll see where this goes. I feel like the most successful icons that we're going to see on big Sur are going to be ones that play with the boundary of the square, even if they lean into the square a little bit. And I think the more successful ones will be the more skeuomorphic ones. Like the ones, sort of like things stands out where it looks like a tray of.
pads of paper, or notes where it looks like a note pad, like these things, have multiple layers of identification and the shape kind of just bounds it versus something like Safari or messages where it's sort of a glyph inside of shape with a color. So I'll be curious to see how this evolves, but it does seem when you showed me that Yosemite evolution, where they went from the wild West to like three pre-approved shapes, and now we're down to one sort of pre-approved shape. It's a very weird progression. we'll just get used to it and forget that this was ever a problem.  

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, I think people have about a two week memory when it comes to stuff. So, this will pass too, probably.

**Brian:** this too shall pass. All right. Well, on that note, let's, let's move on. Let's wrap up with some cool things.

**Marshall:** right. Yeah. Long episode, but let's do some cool things to 

**Brian:** I'll go first. All right, Marshall, I'm going to say something. Tell me if this rings a bell for you

**Marshall:** Okay.

**Brian:** writer. Do you know what that is?  Okay. So if you were on the internet, I guess this, this was like 10 years ago. Oh, flash came from 2006. Okay. So 15 years ago, uh, there's this game called blind rider.
And this game was so fun. I played this all the time. I remember it was, I think he got ported to like a Facebook game and we played this all the time on Facebook. but line writers, this idea, you have this canvas and you can draw lines and then you have this little character that's on a sled and you hit start and it sort of drops your character.
And when it encounters a line, it slides along the lines. You can build intricate tracks and mazes and courses for your. little sledder person.
Anyways, I came across 
this article this week. and the title. I mean, this was just nostalgia central. It says I spent 11 years working on this line writer track and I was like, Holy shit. First of all, I haven't thought about line writer in 11 years.
And this person has spent the last 11 years thinking about it anyways. the course that they created is called omniverse too, which I guess means that they've created omniverse and one in the past. And I watched this video. It's like a three minute video or four minutes. It's very short. And at each.
Sort of there there's sort of phases to it. Uh, when you watch it you'll know what I mean, Laura kind of like zooms out and shows you. The broader perspective of course. And then it'll zoom back in to where your character is at each phase where it zooms out each subsequent time. I was just like, no way, Holy shit.
And like my excitement and disbelief just kept on growing, growing, and growing and growing. And by the end, I just can not believe that a human being had put in the time to create this. It is the most Buckwild wine rider course I've ever seen. four minute video, you should go watch it. It's nuts. It's just insane.
It's really cool. Yeah. Like really the really shows mastery over the intricate physics of it. Like the way you can use little dots in lines to sort of trick the sled character. Like it thinks it's hitting a wall or, bump. And so you can use these little tiny marks to speed it up or slow it down or make it flip over.
And it's really 
 incredible.  

**Marshall:** Cool, my cool thing this week is an iOS game and it's on iPad iOS too called good Sudoku. Brian, I've been talking about Sudoku, I think, uh, two weeks ago I had a Cracking the cryptic as my cool thing.
That YouTube channel. And, uh, yeah. So I've been playing a lot of Sudoku lately and bugging you with screenshots of my accomplishments. Not every day, but pretty frequently. Yeah. But I've been working my way up the difficulty levels. And I'm now on what this app deems to be pro level. I can consistently solve those without getting hints, but this app is great for learning how to place a docu, so, and getting better at it and solving harder problems.
So it's made by two people, I think, uh, Zach gage and Jackie Schlesinger, um, It's definitely a work of passion. These guys, I think, wanted to play Sudoku and play harder puzzles, but, they ran into the difficulties of being a human and only being able to see so many things at a time.
So they built this app to make it easier to kind of focus on what is available and where numbers can go as you're going through. So sometimes in a given box, only one number can go in a given cell. And it's hard to see that, when you're just looking at, you know, on paper or whatever, but with this, it has a focus mode, so it will kind of point out.
Those are called naked singles, Brian, find naked singles in your area. Uh, and, and, uh, there's a lot of weird names for these things. I, I pointed out like there's X wing and Y wing star Wars references, but those are actually like, things you have to identify to help solve thing. Anyways, all this to say, like this app is really well done.
I think you had some, some things to say about its, aesthetics. I think it's fine. It definitely works. It's one of the better looking Sudoku apps in the app store. So you know, take that for what it's worth, but it's made playing Sudoku a lot more fun for me. I'm much better at it than I've ever been before.
And I know what to look for now. I see the game a completely different way now than I used to. So, for what it's worth, if you're just instead, OCO check out good Sudoku
app store.

**Brian:** just reminds me of. Well, hang on. I'll say we started watching the Queen's gambit, which is about chess and, um, okay, cool. Yeah. Well, we'll try and finish it before you listed as a cool thing. Uh, we just started, but, it seems to scratch this very similar itch, which is like a game that is infinitely deep.
But the more you do it, the more quickly you, can almost subconsciously pattern match and identify where things should be or where the next logical move is based on like, you blur your eyes and you see a density of numbers or, you know, your chess pieces in a certain position. Uh, obviously I don't know how I'm not good at chess or anything like that, but it sort of reminds me of that.
Like, you can go infinitely deep, but the deeper you go, you just get very quick at pattern matching. Is that kind of true?

**Marshall:** absolutely. Yeah. I think that's why it appeals to me is because it's very much about geometry, right? It's like, it's not numbers, even though the whole thing is numbers. It's not really numbers so much as it is, like what can go where based on what's already there, you know what I mean? and visual alignment of things Like columns and rows, you know what I mean? So, Uh, yeah. From, yeah. You want to look in the ceiling. All I see is Sudoku games, you know? Yeah. I take my pill every night and I had to just place it OCO on the ceiling. Yeah, exactly. yeah, it's fun, man. I don't know if you're, if you're into it at all, this is the way to play it.
I think because it makes, the easier puzzles so much easier and it makes you want to try the harder ones to actually challenge yourself. Cause that focus mode that I was talking about earlier, it, kind of dumbs down the game a little bit to the point where you want to play harder ones. Cause it's like, Oh yeah, it's just showing me that a five goes there.
I don't have to think to figure that out. I want to be thinking about why wings and like, um, naked, naked singles and 

**Brian:** Yeah. I mean, I love anything that has this vocabulary. That is non-obvious. And you only realize that there's vocabulary once you started getting into the weeds, you know, same thing with chess, like there's a chess vocabulary. And if you aren't good enough or haven't had enough exposure, it's just nonsense, like Queens, Bishop, I don't know.
Like there's weird things that describe the position of things and. you can replay an entire chess match by reading some letters and numbers like that's buck wild. So same thing here. Yeah. You're learning a vocabulary and you develop a shorthand and, uh, for all these things to help you do it more easily or
put articulations on a pattern or the way things behave.
That's cool.

**Marshall:** exactly. And I think that's why I really like this app is because it, teaches you there's a whole like learning section where you can learn all of these things and it'll show you examples. But, eventually you start to see patterns and then you realize there's a name for that. Right. I think that's what you're kind of talking about. And that's a really cool route revelation to have. It's like, Oh, I noticed a pattern and. Yeah, they've already figured this out.
There's a word for it now. Okay, cool. But I figured it out on my own. I realized this looking more. And the people who are really smart, they've already figured this out. I feel smart now, you know,
anyways,

**Brian:** Well, I'm glad you're enjoying it. Uh what's what's the harder difficulty past pro.

**Marshall:** That's the highest levels. Yeah, I actually did solve them, but I needed one hint to do it, but it goes, it goes, beginner, advanced expert pro impossible. So yeah, I'm on, I'm on pro now and the skull ones, every 10 puzzles. There's a skull puzzle, which is harder than usual.
And those are, those are fun challenges. Anyways, I'm done talking about Sudoku.

**Brian:** All right. Well, let's get out of here. as we mentioned in the sidebar, we have a ratio and we are now in deep in the multi hours of editing territory.
