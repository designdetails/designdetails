## Saving People from Themselves

**Marshall:** Uh, Brian, it's a good day.

**Brian:** How's your day.

**Marshall:** I'm feeling much better than we were last week, man.

**Brian:** Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Funny enough. Like we were saying, when last week's episode came out, we would kind of know, So now this is the first episode where something's coming out, where it's like, Oh, we actually know what happened with the election.

**Marshall:** Yup. And that's why I am in a somewhat decent mood. Brian, let's do a show.

**Brian:** Chipper Marshall. Ooh. Welcome to episode three seven two of the design details podcast. I'm Brian Lovin.

**Marshall:** and I'm Marshall back. We'll come back for another episode, Brian, how you doing?

**Brian:** Aye. I'm doing lovely. Spent the weekend in Yosemite, enjoying the F the last a weekend of fall. We basically started getting snow right as we left. So pretty good timing.

**Marshall:** nice. Yeah. Uh, I've been in San Francisco all weekend, but, we're recording on Sunday. So yesterday was Saturday. It was a beautiful, sunny, wonderful day. Today was kind of like a little bit cold and drizzly, but that was awesome. Uh, you know, I got some hot Apple cider, just sit around and watch TV. It's been wonderful.

**Brian:** Yeah. The nice thing about rain in San Francisco is, you know, that it's snowing in the mountains. So if you are into skiing, you crave those rainy days. And you're like, yes, that means it's good stuff this weekend.

**Marshall:** well, you, you know that I'm not into skiing or snowboarding in the mountains because I had no idea there was a correlation

**Brian:** Into rainy days where you have all the reasons in the world to stay inside.

**Marshall:** exactly cuddle up under a blanket and do nothing. Yep.

**Brian:** All right. Well, let's talk about some design today. We got a packed outline. Uh, before we get into it, we've got to shout out our very important pixels. This week. We had some new, patrons on the Patrion. So huge.
Shout out to Jake. Richard Cezanne, Henning, Melissa. Oh, Richie planet Jay Soule and Erin Meyer. Wow.

**Marshall:** I'm not sure if it's Soule or so well, J so well,

**Brian:** J so well, thank you all for supporting the show this week. Uh, we really appreciate it.

**Marshall:** Yes. Thanks everybody.

**Brian:** Okay. Let's get into the sidebar. This week. We had an issue opened up. Well, actually this issue is very old. This is from May 7th. but this issue asked for our opinion on a UX article. And so we clicked through, and we have a lot of link in the show notes.
What the article is titled, why radio buttons and check boxes. Can't co-exist.
And, yeah, Marsh and I w we finally got around to reading this, and I think we disagree with the article. So we thought we would spend today's sidebar talking about radio buttons and check boxes and how to design them to be clear and consistent and understandable for people.

**Marshall:** Yeah. So, uh, maybe we can sum up what this article is saying basically. So the article was saying that, uh, radio buttons, which are those circles with a.in the middle, if you've selected it. And only one of them can be selected at a time single select items and check boxes, which are squares that have a check Mark in them.
And multiple can be selected at a single time. Those are. Similar enough that they should be kind of the same and the fact that we're using boxes and checks for one and circles and dots for the other is confusing to users. And they don't understand the difference between these two things. So we should combine them and make them easier to understand.
Is that a fair assessment of what he's trying to say here?

**Brian:** Yeah, I suppose the ending proposal was to unify around,

**Marshall:** Circle checks.

**Brian:** yeah. Circle checks where you have unfilled circles, but when it's selected, it gets filled with a check Mark icon for both. Checkbox style selection and radio style selection.

**Marshall:** so single select and multi-select looks the same until you tap the second one, then you discover. Whether it was single select or multi-select. And I think we've run into the problem here, Brian, which is it's impossible to tell what the behavior is. Unless maybe there's a text on screen to say select a multiple or only select one.
Okay. But if I don't read that thing, I can't tell at a glance, whether this is a single selector, a multi-select thing, which is what you get when you use checkboxes and radio buttons brand.

**Brian:** Yeah, I think I kind of agree with the premise of, of the author, which is that like the decisions feel kind of arbitrary, like square check circled thought. I guess maybe there's some, some deep logic from, from way back when, about why it is that way. But I think the more important part is just that they're different.
Like you can have any shape in any indicator, as long as it's different than the other style of selection. 
Right.

**Marshall:** Yeah. So we, we did a little bit of an audit here and we looked at how iOS and material do these things. And on iOS, it seems like they do check circles for multi-select, but they do free floating checkmarks or ticks.
If you're from across the pond, a free floating for single select radio buttons. Is that
right? 

**Brian:** Yeah. And we found actually places where they're inconsistent, but an example would be. the free floating check or tick is used in wifi settings to indicate the single wifi network that you were connected to. That is a radio style selection. You can only have one, but if you go into say the notification settings for, uh, an app, they have this sort of alert style and you can choose whether you receive alerts on the lock screen notification center, and banners.
And those use the circle checks and that's because it is a multi-select decision. So that's, I think the rule that they have, which is nice, I guess it's not super intuitive when you're looking at a radio, like, cause there's, just an absence of shape around unselected items, right? Like there's not the empty circle or an empty.
Box. 

**Marshall:** You have to scan the list and tells that there should be something there, but there isn't.

**Brian:** all right,

**Marshall:** Which is the beauty of the circle of the radio button. Is it, it gives you, Hey, there's something that could be here and here's where it would go.

**Brian:** right. So yeah, I don't, I don't actually know. I don't know if I agree with Apple in this either shit.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Well, and what's interesting too, is, you know, the, um, Apple ID sign-in button that they announced like a year ago or something like
that.
yeah. When you choose whether to share your email or hide your email, they use a check circle there as well, but that's a single select, like that's, that's a radio button, but they're using the check circle.
anyways, not entirely consistent, but I think the main point is that you should be consistent. So, um, maybe we talk a little bit about the legacy of this stuff for why these are named and shaped the way they are. you know, if you just think about the name, radio button, like, what the fuck is it called a radio button?
It's a circle of the dot and it, why is it called a radio button? And I think I'm just, I don't know if this is true or not, but 

**Brian:** no, this is true. 

**Marshall:** but 
when you're listening to the radio, uh, you can press one button or another and they're mutually exclusive.
You can only listen to one radio station at a time, hence radio buttons. And I assume checkboxes, go back to forms and, you know, just classic pen and paper type things where you have a list of boxes that you can check, check, all that, apply that phrase, check all that apply pretty common.
do they say tick, all that apply elsewhere? I don't know. Anyways. but yeah, I think that that legacy has, has continued and some of the comments on this article, Point towards that direction of like there's there's years and years, decades, centuries, even of legacy here that these things are leveraging and to change them Willy nilly, just because you want to reinvent the wheel is maybe not the best idea, but,

**Brian:** I actually, now that you've, mentioned the form, like the dot inside of a radio button, it's not random, right? Like that goes back to forms where, when given multiple choices and you're only allowed to select a single one, the design of a paper form is always fill in the dot, right? Like
multiple choice form.
Think about the ballot that you just filled out. If you voted it's like you can only pick one presidential candidate, like fill in the dot. Right.

**Marshall:** Every sat is a multiple choice test with circles and you gotta fill in one a through E or whatever, right? Like that's, A normal thing. So we expect to fill in one circle, but we can check many boxes

**Brian:** Well, so we didn't say what material does, which is this material follows the web's lead, right. Which is squares plus cheques and then circles plus dots for, to distinguish the two.

**Marshall:** Yep. And there's, there's Pretty heavy visual indication that the check isn't just a check inside the box. It actually fills the box and punches out the check, and using a key color, same thing with the dot and the radio button that, that dot almost fills the circle. It leaves a little gap for the outside ring, but it's very obvious what is dotted and what is not, and what is checked and what is not.

**Brian:** So I, I suppose. At the end of the day, like there is a lot of precedent and shapes and visual language that you could lean on that people will be somewhat familiar with and could Intuit what the behavior of the interface will, be like when they start tapping on things. But if you really want to shake it up, kind of like Apple did, like they don't have squares in the interface.
They have circles because they want it to be round and friendly and circles everywhere. Uh, as long as you're consistent about. Distinguishing the two patterns. I think you're probably fine.

**Marshall:** Yep. And I think that's the main sin. This article commits is conflating the two and saying that it doesn't matter. That they're different. I think it very much does. Cause when a user looks at these things without a, you know, in the default state with nothing selected, they need to know how many of them they can tap before it's okay to move on.
  
  **Brian:** Uh, and then maybe it's also just worth, ending on Apple is inconsistent too. So even if you're struggling with it, just remember iOS is
also
 
 **Marshall:** is hard stuff, but pick a pattern and stick to it. That's that's the main thing.

**Brian:** Right. If you didn't know, this is a listener supported podcast, which means that people listening to this show just like you, choose to support us every single month on Patrion, starting at just a dollar a month, uh, you can contribute to the show and make it possible to pay for all of our software hardware.
And just the time it takes to get together and record this every single week, uh, for six years running. And in return, you get access to complete episodes of the show. If you're a Patriot and supporter, you get access to a bonus segment called the sidebar in every episode, which is like an extra listener question or an extra cool thing or something really designed specific.
And it basically nets out to be like an extra half of an episode. Today. We talked about the differences between radio buttons and checkboxes and how to design them correctly so that your users will understand how an interface is meant to work. So if you want to hear about this, and if you want to hear our backlog of sidebars and all future sidebars and complete episodes going forwards, please consider supporting us by going to patrion.com/design details.
 for the price of one sip of coffee 

**Marshall:** Yeah. It's like not even a cup of coffee. It's like two coffees could get you a whole year, you know?

**Brian:** yeah, hang on. This is droplets of coffee. Just thinking about that. All right. Let's uh, do a little bit of follow-up for the main topic. So, right. We got a tweet from Jesse box talking about last episode, where we talked about creating a culture of design excellence.
Jesse says this was an episode that hit me right in the fields. I think you're totally right, Brian, that the ownership of design quality is on us. In my experience, design quality is a longterm challenge. So it's best to bring tasks to developers that are small and easy to understand at my company, we found it works best to have a certain amount of design quality tickets present in each sprint.
It has its own challenges, but I found for both the developer and myself, that it's easier to QA lots of small tasks rather than one huge task. So the second, part of this reminded me of something that we're doing at work that I think is working well. it's kind of a new process, so we'll check back in, but it's very similar to this and it's, it's two parts.
So one, we have like a big master project column or project board for all the work we're doing on the mobile apps. And we have a dedicated column that we just call excellence and cards go in there that are basically. Like sometimes it can be a polished thing, but usually it's like a, something that a developer can maybe spend 30 minutes to an hour on.
It could be a feature. Could just be some, some small fix, something that wouldn't make sense to fit into a regular. Epic or a story that we're trying to ship. Like it's not a huge thing. It doesn't really fit the medically with some of the other things that we're working on, but we recognize that it's important and would sort of round out the interface or the, the product.
so we call that those excellence tasks and. Like Jesse mentioned, one of the important things is that they're small. Well-defined well scoped and easy for somebody to say, you know, Oh, like it's Friday afternoon. I'm maybe not feeling like I want to do my big project, but I have an hour what's, what's something I could do to just knock it out.
And like having a very small, clearly defined task, I think has been good for that. So I don't know it's relatively new, but we're working on that style of, Like making sure we get the design Polish shipped regularly. Right? Like I think we want to avoid having to have some big design debt sprint sometime in the future where it's like, look, the app's gotten out of control.
We have so much shit that's broken. We have to just go through and Polish everything. It kind of sucked to do that. So if we can do it incrementally in between all the other work, 

**Marshall:** Tidy up as you go.

**Brian:** thanks for the tweets, Jesse.

**Marshall:** Yeah.  We also got a tweet from either Michael or Michelle van Heest. Uh, he says Brian should write a book and design details should be transcribed. And, uh, that first one I can't help you with, but the second one, good news. We are transcribed.
We have transcriptions for every episode available on our

**Brian:** Yeah, transcripts. Uh, if you go to get hub.com/design details slash design details, uh, you'll find our repo with, uh, a folder called transcripts and we're putting them all there. And, uh, you can feel free to poke around if you spot anything. That's I incorrectly transcribed, which there will be lots of mistakes cause we are not taking a whole lot of time to edit these.
Uh, we'd appreciate a poll request.

**Marshall:** But, uh, has, has that book come in, Brian, he's still, uh, still working on that novel,
 
 **Brian:** It's it's writing itself in my head, actually. Marshall 

**Marshall:** Yeah. Yeah. Let me know how that goes.

**Brian:** Sure.

**Marshall:** All right.

**Brian:** Main topic.
 Alright. This week's main topic is a listener question from Divya talk long time fam of the pod Divya tweeted at us and says, not sure if this has already been tackled, but what are the things you do to quote unquote, save the users from themselves along the lines of game makers, toolkits videos for the same thing in game design.

**Marshall:** Yeah. There's a really good video from game maker's toolkit about saving gamers from themselves. I think we might even talk about it in the show, but we can put it in the show notes here, of things

**Brian:** Oh, we have a list. We got a long list. All right. Should we just alternate and just fucking crank these out? Cause we've got like 20. Okay. I'll start. So the first thing to, save users from themselves. Have you ever been on a website, filling out a long form and you accidentally refresh the page or you accidentally click back or you accidentally click a link and it takes you away from that form.
And then you go back and all your shit's lost. Wow. Isn't that really annoying? What if application developers, software designers, persisted draft content that you've typed? 

**Marshall:** uh, wouldn't that be nice? Brian? I have developed a coping mechanism of anytime I leave a text field that I think I might not get back to immediately. I copy of that shit 

**Brian:** Copy and paste it. Yep.

**Marshall:** yeah, th this, this poor implementation of drafts has fueled that coping mechanism for me, this happens in Airbnb, on the host side, at least like I gotten burned on that a bunch of times. Yeah. This is one of the worst feelings of really thinking through a response or typing out something really methodically for a second coming back.
And it's all gone.

**Brian:** Yeah, so persists that draft content always, always.

**Marshall:** Uh, another thing you can do and in the same way of destructiveness is warn people before you let them delete something. This is a pretty obvious one, but, uh, yeah. Don't let me delete something right away. Ask me, are you sure

**Brian:** just to add onto that. I like a lot of, products will have that confirmation step. So you tap to delete something. It'll ask you to confirm or cancel. one small detail that I appreciate is when people. Don't place the confirmation button in the same real estate as the initial deletion button was so that you can't accidentally like double tap or double click and, click that confirmation inadvertently.
So having it placed like to the left or the right or something like forcing you to move your mouse and, consciously click that confirmation. Uh, I like that pattern.

**Marshall:** Yeah were even talking about this last week. We we're talking about menus versus actions, sheets, and iOS and iOS 14. Moving forward will force you to go all the way down to the bottom of the screen and tap on delete and the action sheet rather than being in a menu right near where that initial trigger was.

**Brian:** So speaking of deletion, uh, let's say you do delete something or. Maybe even not deleting something, but even just like mutating something editing or, or 
 overriding, let people undo it.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Or even a, an explicit button that shows up in that place or in a bar somewhere that allows me to undo. Yeah. Give me some time.  after you give me that undo like, uh, potentially there's, there's some things that, I may only want to undo for a certain amount of time, like send an email. Oops. I accidentally hit send, it gives me some time to undo and maybe the way that works is. Just don't do the thing until the undo button goes away.
Just like, wait on it for a little while. Uh, alternatively, if you can actually undo the thing, like you, can't, unsend an email, but, on something that's just the setting or something like that, you can undo that, pretty quickly, like show that button for a little while, but maybe it goes away and I can always get back to it later.


**Brian:** Yep. as you were talking about that, I had to add one thing to the list that this reminded me of. So in Gmail, if you accidentally send an email, you get a little prompt to undo and you can prevent the email from being sent, but have you ever accidentally, like you're typing an email and you're like, um, the PDF is attached and you hit enter and you send it, but you forgot to attach the thing.
And a long time ago, at some point, Google recognized this was a problem. And so they do some sort of content scanning, I guess, looking for phrases, like see attached or is attached. And if there's no attachment on the email, they will prompt you to confirm that you didn't mean to attach something.

**Marshall:** Same thing. If you try to send an email without a subject.  This is not the normal format. Are you sure you want to do this, but yeah, that's a really smart of like sure that you follow through on the promises that you've made. Yeah. Another way to, help users is to, or I guess, save them from themselves is use sensible defaults.
We, we use this term all the time on the show, Brian, but yeah, sensible defaults. Make sure that the way the app starts out,  

**Brian:** Another way that this gets phrased in the engineering world is convention over configuration, Which is this idea that most people are probably trying to solve similar problems in similar ways. And so if your application or your framework or whatever it is, can just go ahead and solve that.
And maybe people can object out of that through some configuration or script or, or like deeper advanced setting. That's great. But if you know that certain problems are just going to be solved in the same way over and over and over again. you can assume that that's the convention that, that someone would want to have as a preference.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I like that convention over configuration. That's pretty cool. Uh, here's another one. This is a little bit straightforward, but, maybe not as obvious, tap target size. So maybe you're representing something onscreen. That's kind of small and you probably shouldn't do that because it makes people feel stressed that they have to tap the specific pixels that you've shown them, but giving them a larger tap target size, or at least the minimum taps target size for that platform.
44 on iOS and 48 on Android. giving them. A sizeable area be successful when they go to tap, that thing

**Brian:** I try to be super generous with that. Like if there's controls in say like, let's say you have a card design and there's like a, a Chevron or a overflow.dot.in the top right corner. yeah, you could just put a 44 by 44 point bounding box around that icon and great. You're following the heck.
You've complied with a large enough tap target. But I think another way to think about it is if somebody's tapping anywhere in the top right corner, they're probably going for that action. So you could make a huge, almost like a. quarter circle, tap target, if that was possible. But like that whole upper corner, it doesn't even matter if it's 44.
It could be whatever, like 64 by 64. but just being generous with that top target, cause you kind of couldn't make assumptions about what's happening. If someone mishaps the far edge or something.
 All right. Another one, this is like saving people from the product that you've created. That's addicting and, keeps you, keeps you hooked, but like Instagram's end of feed check Mark. So when you've scrolled far enough in your feed and you've seen all the new posts, they.
Present this little card with the check Mark and an animation. And there's a little bit of a delay before you can scroll any further that says, Hey, you've caught up. Like, you can take a break if you want. So similar to Netflix is, are you still watching? So just prompting people, Hey, you know, you sure you're happy with your, your behavior right now?
Like Just checking in. That's kind of nice. And this reminds me of, you know, like this is screen time. there's like bedtime reminders there's do not disturb. So there's a lot of features that are getting built into not only apps, but operating systems that are trying to bring some of this like mental health addictiveness, of software products to people's attention.
 
 **Marshall:** show me how much time I've been using this app or, give me an option to, to limit myself, right? Yeah, exactly. I think another good way help people out. Yeah. And this way is to, um, provide multiple entry points to the same thing. So for example, maybe you have like notification settings and obviously that should be one row inside of your normal settings, but maybe you have a notifications page or notifications tab or something that people can go to having a link straight to those notification settings from that page is really useful.
So, give it to me contextually of like, Oh yeah, let me change the settings for this thing. I'm currently on jumped straight to that page.

**Brian:** love it. Uh, another one, this one's pretty niche, but maybe there's a broader application, but it's this idea of warning people before something gets really loud. So this is like on headphones. I think maybe, I don't know, the iOS does it, but I feel like, old iPods used to have. Like volume thresholds, where basically you could cap how loud the system was allowed to play, to protect your ears.
Okay. Yeah. So that kind of control, uh, saves people from destroying their, your drums.

**Marshall:** Here's another one, Brian, mature content warnings or, or, you know, kind of a roadblock or an age gate for a certain content that might be. before a user goes and looks at it.

**Brian:** yeah, I, I like this. I know Reddit does this. I think Twitter does this. Like if there is something that is flagged as adult content, the image, it gets heavily blurred

**Marshall:** yeah, Apollo does this and this is so good because it saved me
scrolling through all at work or in public, you know, it's like, please blur, 

**Brian:** yeah. Yeah. That's the thing scrolling at work.
uh, speaking of, of Reddit, I feel like they do this really well, which is hiding spoilers.  Yeah. And in fact, I feel like it's been a proposed addition to the markdown syntax, which is a way to explicitly block out text that is a spoiler and users can select it or hover over it. And it would. Reveal text.
And this is great for people who are just casually browsing, you know, instead of having to mute everything, which I do when a new movie comes out, for example, I just mute the shit out of every term I could think of, cause I don't want them to spoilers, but if people had the option to say like, Hey, this thing contains spoilers, I'm going to be plight
  
  **Marshall:** Yeah. And, and think about it, you know, it's not just text, right? Like, think about what could be spoilery about your content. For example, in a, if it's a sports game, it might be the duration of it, right? Like if the game ends super quick and I can see that it's only an hour when a normal game that is competitive last two hours.
Well, I know that it was a blowout and I'll have to look as the teams and like, okay, this team is about on that team. They probably won. Right.

**Brian:** Yeah, that's good. Yeah. Especially a man. Yeah. For any sports. I imagine they have to think about like people who are rewatching or they have a sports. Team that they've favorited. And they're just trying to catch up on a score after the fact, maybe they want certain parts of the game,
  
  **Marshall:** yeah, the score is obvious, but there, there are other ways to derive exactly what happened during the game, uh, that you should also consider hiding for spoilers. here's another one, Brian raid shake. So, um, I think this exists on most Google apps, but, uh, if you shake your phone, it pulls up a feedback thing.
So if you get pissed at your phone,

**Brian:** Yeah, I love this. I feel like. Nobody ever discovers this, but the idea behind it's kind of funny. It's like, you're frustrated that something's not working and you shake your phone and you're like, why the fuck isn't this working? And then that's the moment. And you prompt someone that.
Yeah. All right, this next one is new ish. And this is how do you prevent people from accidentally spreading misinformation? So there's a couple patterns here. One, that is recent is Twitter changed the default behavior for the retweet button. It used to be that it would show a dropdown and you could choose between retweeting or quote tweeting.
It has now changed. It just opens the quote tweet prompt, and you can choose whether or not you want to type text, but the prompts alone forces you to consider, or at least reminds you that you're contributing something to the conversation. And if you can add to that, you might end up changing your mind to share something.
Uh, similarly, I think this is implemented on Facebook and maybe Twitter, maybe WhatsApp and Instagram. but there's a pattern now of warning people before they share something that contains a link, which they didn't actually tap into. So this would prevent people from sharing things based only on headlines.

**Marshall:** that never happens, Brian.
Just
mindlessly echoing and
parroting something somebody else has said. Yeah, that's weird.

**Brian:** Yeah.
if only everyone just paid attention to that. Right. 

**Marshall:** Uh, well that leads into this last one, which I think is a nice way to leave off, which is, reminders for civility or to discourage toxicity. So, paying attention to what somebody writes in a text field before they send it in like a live chat or a comment section or something like that.
and saying, Hey, it looks like you might be saying some, Questionable stuff. You want to

**Brian:** I like that. And I don't know. I, I feel like there's degrees of intensity on how those prompts should be triggered because

**Marshall:** Yeah. Also the wording is important of how you, how you phrase are you sure you want to say that, but  just the simple act of making someone think twice about what they're saying is enough to stop

**Brian:** but sorry, you said that was the last one, but as you were saying it, I remember one more and this is really cool. so there's a feature called I think secret scanning or code scanning. I don't actually remember the name of the feature, but it's a security preference you can enable that looks for, password, like strings of text that might get committed to a repository of code.
And it will warn you and say, Hey, it looks like you've committed a secret. You should probably revoke it because it's public and anybody could see it and use it. Um, and this happens, you know, asynchronously in the background. So you can just have this stuff happen, without having to manually review everything.
Like if it gets committed, you're going to get prompted.

**Marshall:** Well, you just made me think of another one, Brian, which is, uh, Most apps that you use to, to live stream like OBS, or I forget there's a bunch of them, but a lot of these, you have to have like a stream key.
That is a unique key. And if you happen to show that key live on stream, people can, can get into your stuff. So by default, it's hidden and you have to click a button to reveal it a similar thing with

**Brian:** Oh, that's nice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And there's probably so many more. I love this. This is fun. We should maybe convert this into a blog post, like the big list of design patterns to save people from themselves.
I love this. Divya. Thank you for asking this on Twitter. if anyone else has something that comes to mind, please tweet at us. Maybe we can make this a really well thought out list. but other things that we might've missed would be great to hear about. So tweet at us at design details. FM. 

**Marshall:** Sweet, cool things. 

**Brian:** Okay. I'll go first. my cool thing this week is a person and it's. This person's on wine content, which includes their Twitter profile, but mostly their blog posts. This person is Patrick McKenzie. he goes by patio 11, everywhere.

**Marshall:** Okay. Yeah, I've heard this name before and not his real name, but patio 11 

**Brian:** yeah. So Patty 11 is very famous on hacker news. Currently works at Stripe, but is famous for lots of reasons. And one of those reasons is he writes incredible blog posts. So his website is kalzumeus.com. We'll have a link in the show notes. here's what I'll say. Some of these are like career changing blog posts.
So his most popular one is called salary negotiation. In fact, I think The title change. I think it used to be salary negotiation for software engineers or something, but now it's more broadly applicable and the subtext is make more money and be more valued. And this is a massive fucking blog post. I didn't get.
He says it's 7,000 words plus, so it's a long read, but it's the kind of article that just captures. Real things happening in the industry that no one's going to bother to tell you, unless you really dig around and ask, or just make every mistake in the book and just end up 10 years down the road, realizing how much, money you missed out on.
And so that's just one of his blog posts I'll link to it, but he has a section on his site called greatest hits. Other links there include, uh, don't call yourself a programmer and other career advice. And, falsehoods programmers believe about names, which is a fascinating, article about just how we deal with names.
How are you with people's names actually, in software, which equally applies to designers as it does to developers. So there's just good stuff here. So I've been following Patrick for. I guess six years now and have, have enjoyed reading his, his writing and kind of following along with his career. So, uh, patio 11 on Twitter, otherwise we'll have linked to his blog in the show notes. 

**Marshall:** Cool.

**Brian:** All right. Hit me.

**Marshall:** my cool thing is a video game, Brian. It's been awhile, been awhile, but uh, not even playing this game, I'm just watching someone play it on YouTube, but it's really fucking good. So, uh, it's a game called control Canada over a year ago, but, it's like this mix between X-Files and lost and, uh, Kiera, uh, if, if that puts something in your head, I don't know if you've ever seen her.
Sorry, Akita. And I don't know if you're seeing, Akira, but, yeah, it's like, it's this fun kind of mystery. parents, natural telekinesis, uh, all, all sorts of like crazy stuff. Like mundane objects that have special powers. Well, the premise is like your, uh, when you were children, you and your brother, Encountered this strange event and your brother was taken away and you've spent you're the sister you've spent your entire life looking for him.
And you finally been the lead to New York with this big giant building that no one else seems to really notice, but it's really huge and brutalist architecture really cool. And, uh, you're allowed into this building and almost immediately become. The director who has just killed himself.
So now you're in charge of this federal Bureau of control, which is like a secret of government agency that, keeps these. Extra planar, supernatural objects from ruining the world. So that's how I kind of mean by like X-Files slash second season loss slash Akira has like, there's a super powers and stuff.
I'm not selling it very well, but like it's a beautiful game. It uses Ray tracing. So, all the reflections and everything is just really gorgeous that the particle effects like, so, like I said, you pick up these super powers, throughout the game.
And one of them is you can kind of do this dash move or you zoom forward really fast. And when you do chunks fall off of the walls, revealing rebar and like papers go fly in and desks flip over. It's really cool. Like everything in the environment is distractible and by the time of fight is over that the room is just destroyed.
It's really, really fucking cool. 
But, yeah, control 

**Brian:** I only watched the trailer before we started recording this. And even the trailer is dope. It's got some good music in it, so people should watch that.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Just, I love the lore. There's there's all this really cool lore. And, and I'm watching Christopher OD, who I've mentioned before on the show is like The channel that I watch when I do watch people play these longer games, Christopher OD is really great at this stuff. Not so good at the combat, tend to fast forward through that, but as far as like paying attention to every audio file and like letter and side mission and all the lore and stuff like that, he's a great one to watch.

**Brian:** Cool. Well, links in the show notes. Uh, yeah, that's it. This has been episode 372. We hope you enjoyed it. let us let you thought, hit us with, your other cool, design things that help save people from themselves in, in your products.

and, and finally, uh, just as a reminder, transcripts for episodes are going up on our get hubs. So get hub.com/design details slash design details. Look for the transcripts folder. if you want to read those, or if you're feeling generous and want to just submit a poll request and fix a couple of typos or some, misspellings or anything like that, I guess that's the same thing.
