## 369: Shallow Design Culture

**Brian:** So uh, how's it going?
Welcome to episode 369 of the design details podcast. I'm Brian Lovin.

**Marshall:** Nice. I'm Marshall Bock. We'll come back for another episode. How you doing Brian?

**Brian:** Fantastic. I played Overwatch for the first time in like... five months? Cause I was, I was gone without access to a personal computer device,

**Marshall:** Gaming.

**Brian:** gaming Windows, Gaming PC. Thank you. And so I played Overwatch for about seven hours today. It was awesome.

**Marshall:** Amazing. Amazing.

**Brian:** And, um, I ended exactly where I started SR wise. So seven hours.

**Marshall:** I consider that a win man. That's like, it's like going to the casino and breaking even like that's, that's a good day.

**Brian:** yeah, yeah. but yeah man, God, that game is so fun.

**Marshall:** Jealous. I, my work setup has taken over my gaming desk and I basically don't have a gaming PC set up anymore. I still have my PlayStation and Xbox hooked up to the TV. So can play those, but yeah, no more PC gaming for Marshall and I need to figure something out for when Cyberpunk comes out in here in a few weeks, because that's going to be important.

**Brian:** you're going to need another desk, I guess, right? A work desk and a game desk?

**Marshall:** Yeah. I don't know what I'm going to do, man. Playing a console. Lol

**Brian:** no, that don't do that. Alright. Shall we get into

**Marshall:** yeah, let's do it.

**Brian:** All right. We've got a couple, a golden ratio supporters this week, making the show possible as always who try not to CuriosityStream CuriosityStream lets you learn about any topic.

**Marshall:** Thank you.

**Brian:** We also have some new VIP this week. Huge shout out to our very important pixels. Joern. Yorn. I'm going to go Yorn.

**Marshall:** Yeah?

**Brian:** A "J" but just the letter.

**Marshall:** Maybe it's "Yuh?"

**Brian:** "Yuh?"

**Marshall:** Because if Jorn is Yorn then maybe this is just Yuh.

**Brian:** Yuh. Thank you, Yuh.

**Briand and Marshall** laughs

**Brian:** Braden Sweeten and long time friend of the pod Alterrique Ingram, uh, Al, previous guests on the show, Episode 128.

**Marshall:** Nice. That's a good number too.

**Brian:** Al was on that episode with Ben Mingo called "I Call Shotgun!" That was a long, long time ago and yeah, a nice round number. So. Welcome to the fam, Al.

**Marshall:** Welcome.

**Brian:** Alright, let's get into the sidebar, Marshall. The sidebar this week. Let's, let's talk about the Apple event. I assume I can only assume everyone is a saturated on the Apple event, but, you know what? I think people are really just itching for our hot takes our specific opinions.

**Marshall:** It's, other people can say what they want to, but it's really what's in our brains that counts, Brian.

**Brian:** Yeah. That's the most important thing. Um, so let's jump in.

**Marshall:** Alright. So I guess maybe something I should say first is that I kind of spoiled myself for this one and I've been spoiling myself lately just in general, like. So when it comes to movies, I do not watch spoilers. I don't even watch trailers. I'll watch the trailer for a movie until I decide. Yeah. I want to watch this movie and then I'll stop watching the trailer mid trailer. Right. Like I'm that dilligent about not being spoiled for movies and stuff. But, when it comes to like this tech stuff, exact opposite. So, I watched this channel on YouTube called *Everything Apple Pro*. There's a bunch of them, but this is the one that, uh, I've kind of gravitated to. I think he's grown pretty big, but basically it's like a channel that talks about everything Apple and they collect rumors and talk about, uh, new features when beta releases are put out.

So because of that, I knew most of the stuff that was going to be available today and it was,

**Brian:** Uh-huh.

**Marshall:** Yeah, so. But, uh, we're going to be talking about some rumors that didn't come true later. And I just want to mention that as a source of where we're hearing some of these rumors.
So if you're not watching that, it's a pretty good channel. There's a bunch of others like Brandon Butch, and a Zillow Tech and iOS Updates and yeah, there's some good channels out there. The thing that bugs me about Everything Apple Pro, Brian, then maybe, maybe I shouldn't be promoting his channel because he doesn't know the words.

**Brian:**  Oh...

**Marshall:** So like, he'll talk about doing stuff on the phone and say, click on this, click on that. And like that's a tap.

**Brian:** And you're like tap, dammit, tap!

**Marshall:** Okay, that's a small one, but he'll call like anything an icon. Like a container could be an icon. A text label could be an icon. A button could be an icon. An illustration could be an icon.
He doesn't know the words for things. So if you can get past that, the content is good otherwise. Anyways, let's talk about this Apple event, Brian.

**Brian:** Okay, let's start. Let's just go order of operations here, uh, HomePod mini,

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** That is a new product. The successor, or... companion? I don't know, to the HomePod.

**Marshall:** Sibling?

**Brian** Sibling. Sure. Yeah. My, my first impression is, it's fine. You know, I've been able to experience both HomePods and Sonos, and they just both have trade offs.
Like I love that HomePods integrate more deeply with the Apple ecosystem, but they're just worse for audio playback if you appreciate listening to music from multiple sources.

**Marshall:** Mhm.

**Brian** Uh, so like, if you are a Spotify user home, pods are just kind of frustrating cause you always have to go through the, the airplay menu,

**Marshall:** Yep.

**Brian** As opposed to Sonos. You just pop open the app and it's gonna, instead of choosing the sound output, uh, you're more just like picking the rooms and you can have like configurations for those. So I don't know. I've been frustrated with HomePods because I want them, but they, I just know that they won't work with my particular setup. So I thought it was a cool product announcement, but not for me.

**Marshall:** Uh, I think we're going to get a few. Uh, so we have Sonos throughout the house, which has the word built in, I don't want to say her name because I don't want to invoke her for everyone listening if they have speakers on. But, I think the thing that really appealed to my partner, Virginia, is the Intercom feature.
Uh, cause she does this thing where she'll like yell across the house, and I'm like, just come into the room that I'm in.

**Brian**  Uh-huh.

**Marshall:** So, this is a potential solution for that. Uhhm *laughs*. But, but also, like, the thing you said about like integration with the OS, like, that's kind of the thing I don't like about Sonos is like, unless you have one of the new ones that has Airplay 2, you have to go to the app and I would prefer to go through control center for all that stuff personally. Like I'd rather pick the output than go to a specific app to do all of my sound management stuff.
I just want it to work at the OS level. So, this was kind of appealing for that. Less for like a music listening thing. We'll probably put one in like the master bathroom for like listening to while taking a shower, one in the kitchen, and then one in my office so that while she's working upstairs, she can talk to me while I'm down in the office. I think it'll work out and they look really nice.
Like, I'll get a black one for down here on my black desk, but we'll get a white one in the bathroom, you know? I dunno. I'm into it. But I think the thing that's most appealing about the new home pod is that they get the *naming* good, Brian.

**Brian:** *laughs* You like mini?

**Marshall:** Yeah, well, it's like they, they figure it out. Well, I guess this entire event is like, kind of solidified some of the vernacular that they're starting to use of like, and maybe I'm getting ahead of ourselves, but, There's the, The Thing. And then there's smaller versions of it are called Mini and bigger versions of it are called Max. And then there's The Thing and if it's like the more expensive, fully featured version, it's just Pro. And then you apply those words as necessary.

Like, I think that makes a whole lot of sense, and we haven't been there for a while, like R and SE and all this stupid shit that doesn't make sense. Like, no, there's the iPhone and get a better iPhone or littler iPhone or get a better iPhone and it's big. Right? Like. Straightforward.

**Brian:** *laughs* We're going to simplify our words so five-year-old could understand.

**Marshall:** Seriously!

**Brian:** You want a big phone or you want a little phone?

**Marshall:** Hey man. And you know, they were already better than like Sony with their, letter number salad, but like,  at least it's consistent now. So that makes me very, very happy.

**Brian:** Yeah. The price point is appealing though. They're a hundred bucks versus, you know, Sonos. Like if you want to get a Sonos ecosystem in your house, you're like, ugh
this is going to be thousands of dollars. Cause it's there 300, 200 each or something like that. And you probably want a couple. That shit adds up.

**Marshall:** Yeah, exactly. The three I want to get from my house would be one speaker from Sonos. So yeah. And we already have the Sonos set up, which is, it's more of like a, that's what I listened to music through. This will be more of like asking questions and doing smart home stuff and like intercom talking between rooms.

**Brian:** Sure. Yeah. Cool. Alright. How about, um, let's move on. iPhone 12. The next generation.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I found four, I mean, 12.

**Brian:** Yeah, this is what I wrote down. Form factor. What's old is new.

**Marshall:** I'm not complaining by the way.

**Brian:** I'm not complaining either. You know, my favorite iPhone is still the iPhone 5. Um, mostly for the form factor and the color. Uh, I thought it was just such a nice device and they're kind of going back to the roots, but of course, we now have edge to edge display, the notch, the face ID, all that kind of stuff.

**Marshall:** Mm-hm.

**Brian:** So these look nice, the colors are nice. I like that they're sort of rotating colors every year. They seem a little bit like more muted and pastel this year. In the past, they've been like a little more saturated and vibrant.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I think they're saving those for the, uh, for the pro line now.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. How much do you have to say about the iPhone 12?

**Marshall:** The one that's interesting to me is not the iPhone 12, it's iPhone 12 mini. Right.

**Brian:** Okay yeah.

**Marshall:** Um, I think I might get that one - my little tiny hands. I think that iPhone 12 mini might be more my speed. It's the full screen design, minus the fucking notch, but, the same size that, you know, a normal phone used to be. I'm, I'm stoked.
I'll be getting that one. I'll probably get, I dunno. I'm going to get a couple of test devices regardless for, for work. And I'll probably get a mini and a normal 12, cause I already have a max from last generation to test on. I don't think that screen sizes have changed? Although, what's interesting is assuming the iPhone 12 mini is at a 3x resolution, Brian, I think it's going to be 360 width, which is the first time we'll have like a reasonable number to design for in a long time on an iPhone. Like 375 has been the world for a long time and it sucks. It sucks. I hate it. So 360 will be a breath of fresh air. Hence my wanting to get that as a test device.

**Brian:** Nice. Okay. Yeah. I, now I want to get one of those as a test device too.

**Marshall:** I'm extrapolating based on resolution and assuming a density.

**Brian:** Mm-hm.

**Marshall:** But, yeah.

**Brian:** So, the mini is nice. I think a lot of people have been wanting smaller phones. Cause the trend for the last few years has just been bigger and bigger and bigger. Uh, the nice thing for me is like you get a smaller form factor, but bigger screen just because of the edge to edge. So that's compelling. What else is new? *laughs* Like...

**Marshall:** Nothing, really.

**Brian:** There's ceramic shield, better processor, like, some updated camera stuff. I don't know, this felt nothing was surprising, but everything is very good. Like this is a very, very good phone.

**Marshall:** Yep.

**Marshall:** But nothing was surprising. *laughs* I saw a tweet. The tweet that I loved was on their, their marketing. They say, uh, the iPhone 12 has aerospace grade aluminum edges, and the iPhone pro has a surgical grade stainless steel. And the person asked what if you're an astronaut who does surgery in space? What's the best iPhone for you? *laughs*

**Marshall:** Yeah, how can we know?

**Brian:** I dunno, I guess you have to have both.

**Marshall:** It's the iPhone Pro Pro. *laughs*

**Brian:**  Yeah. Um, okay, well then should we, should we move on to the iPhone 12... Pro?

**Marshall:** Yeah. Let's talk about fancy one, the iPhone Expensive.

**Brian:**  Yeah, yeah.

**Marshall:** Boy, oh boy. That gold version is gonna sell like hotcakes to use an antiquated term, Brian. Like, I don't know. Do hot cakes sell well? Like I guess I assumed, I dunno.

**Brian:** *laughs* Yeah.

**Marshall:** But yeah, that, I mean, considering how well the actual gold version sold, like imagine this is going to do really well in Asia. Like when I w when I went to Japan, everybody had a gold phone.

**Brian:** I mean, it looks. Yeah, it looks good. This is the first year I was tempted to get a gold phone. I've never had a gold phone, always done like space gray.

**Marshall:** Yeah, black. Black always.

**Brian:** Um, well, I mean, that's another thing that I wanted to mention is there's no more space gray and I can't remember, it's hard to keep up, but is this the first year they haven't had a space gray in the lineup?

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** Because the 12 has a black option and the 12 pro has graphite,

**Marshall:** Graphite, yeah.

**Brian:** which is not the same thing.

**Marshall:** But again, it's a term that they use. It's within the lexicon, right? Like uh, on macOS there was like, graphite was, it turned everything gray instead of having like the red, yellow, green traffic light, it was all greys.

**Brian:** I didn't connect that, yeah.

**Marshall:** Yeah. So it's, it's already in the lexicon, so it makes sense that they would use that. Space Gray didn't always make sense to me. I don't know. It's cause it's like, eh, it's charcoal. Graphite makes a whole lot of sense, but, I don't know. I like Google's names for their colors.

**Brian:** Which are?

**Marshall:** They're a lot more fun. It's just like Just Black, Clearly White, uh, Kind of Orange,

**Brian:** *laughs*

**Marshall:** you know, and stuff like that. Yeah, I think those are fun. But yeah, I'm, I'm a big fan. I'll be getting that black. I would prefer like, I mean, I don't know if you watch Marquez Brownlee MKBHD on the YouTubes, but he's a big matte black guy. Like yeah. Everything matte black, please.

**Brian:** Yeah, I think this might be the first year I go silver. I don't think I've ever had a white iPhone, but God damn it looks really good on the Pro.

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, well, it's different now because the face doesn't have a forehead or chin, so you don't get any color on the front. It's all sides and back, right?

**Brian:** Yep, yep.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Which is different. Like I never wanted to look at a black rectangle on the face of my phone, which is why I never got white before. Right. Because you had to deal with white forehead and chin. Now it's just all black in the front. So it doesn't really matter what color you get. It's going to look nice from the front regardless.

**Brian:** And we should probably talk about cases because it's very likely that people are going to start putting these in cases because...

**Marshall:** Oh, yeah. MagSafe!

**Brian:** Yeah, you want to talk about that?

**Marshall:** Yeah. This is, dude. This is going to open up an entire branch of the ecosystem. I think like, I mean the obvious stuff from like pop sockets and, you know, every, every single accessory you could imagine, like wallets and cases and stuff, but I think there's going to be things, especially if, um, in future versions of this, there is a open source API for people to do stuff once it's plugged on. Like to be able to attach, something onto your phone to extend the phone hardware, you know what I mean? More than just like, yeah, you can slap your wallet on the back of it or put it in the case and it doesn't pop out. Like if something can snap to the back of the phone and talk to the phone and the phone can talk to it, that's fucking huge. So I don't know. I feel like this is like a whole universe that's starting to open.

**Brian:** I'm excited to play with it. I'm going to reserve any judgment until I test it because this feels like one of those things, and I'm sure that they got it good, which is you need a tension between how strong the magnet is so that it holds and how weak it is that you can lift the phone off of a stand or a mount or whatever it might be with one hand. So for example, the, the new iPad pros with the magic keyboard case, that magnet is strong as fuck.

**Marshall:** It's too fucking strong. I was just going to ask you, I think it's too strong.

**Brian:** Yeah, you have to, two-hand that baby off. And like, if it's the same here with the phone, it'll be great if you're mounting it in your car, like you'll know it's always going to be there, but if you want it on your desk, uh, I don't know.
These are the most minute of problems. I think it's going to be great for the ecosystem and hopefully continue to usher us into a cable free world where people are more inclined to use the wireless charging, which honestly, like I bought wireless chargers for people. And the biggest reason that they stop using them is because you have to perfectly center it on the thing. And like, that's just not something people want to deal with. Or if it accidentally gets nudged a tiny bit, it'll stop charging. When you go back to it, it's low battery and like these frustrating little moments just force people to pick the cable. But if we can solve that problem, then maybe our wireless future is even closer, who knows.

**Marshall:** Yeah, I think it's twofold. Right? I think it's, part of it is the alignment. But also, part of it is the feedback that you aligned it well, right? Like having the screen change to show me. And I don't know if you noticed that the new battery design on the iPhone, it looks a lot more like the circular battery bar that Watch uses when you plug your watch in.

**Brian:** Like in the status bar?

**Marshall:** No, sorry. When you, when you put it on the MagSafe charger.

**Brian:** Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It'll reflect the shape of, yeah.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Well, yeah, but yeah. And instead of showing that overly rendered battery, now we'll get a nice flat circle. Time is a flat circle Brian.

**Brian:** I mean, Apple loves their rings, man. And I was actually thinking, when I saw this design, I was like - obviously people want their phones charged, but there's something really satisfying about like the Apple watch activity rings, right?

**Marshall:** Oh, yeah.

**Brian:** People love to fill those up. And I wonder if it's the same thing here with the battery now. Like, that design, it just lends itself to wanting to be complete, whereas like a bar filling up from left to right. I don't know. It doesn't feel quite the same. I don't know. Maybe I'm overthinking that one.

**Marshall:** Well, here's the thing about circular progress bars, to get a little bit design-y on us, Brian is.

**Brian:** Oh about time. Let's do it.

**Marshall:** They're far easier for people to judge the percentage without an actual number, because like a clock you can tell 75, 50, 25% a lot easier than you can judge that on linear bar.

**Brian:** Oh, interesting.

**Marshall:** You know what I mean?

**Brian:** Mm-hm.

**Marshall:** Like we're designers, we can judge half pretty easily by eye, but the average person, six o'clock, that's a lot easier.

**Brian:** Got it. Hm.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Anyways, uh, the thing about mag safe that bugs me though, is we lost it on Mac book and now we're getting it back on iPhone. I hope we get it back on the new MacBooks. Brian, what do you think?

**Brian:** This is just, *sigh*

**Brian:** Cause I thought they were getting away from MagSafe entirely. Right? They removed it from MacBooks. They haven't used that term on any new products. Like they're not, that's not what they're calling it on the iPad keyboard. Right? Like anytime they use magnets, they're not calling it MagSafe. I thought they'd given up on that property, but now they're bringing it back. So like, will we get it on MacBooks? I don't know.

**Brian:** I mean, the answer is I hope so. I guess this kind of leads into another point that I had about this whole event. Like one of the announcements was that the new phones won't be shipping with, sort of a brick to plug into a wall. And this is frustrating because, like I don't even know how to articulate this. It just feels like the USB-C transition has kind of been a clusterfuck, and like, continues to be a clusterfuck, and you can't just get a cable that works for all of your devices. Like, my phone's plug is different from my iPad's plug is different from my computers.
And like, I guess, the iPad and the MacBook are the closest dock cause at least it's USB-C in, but then your phone is different. I think the Apple watches, maybe they fixed it, but like when I bought the series five, it's still shipped with like a USB A port to the magnetic charging part. Like. The cable story is just a clusterfuck.
And like, this must be so confusing. I mean, it's confusing for me. It must be confusing for people who don't spend 24 hours a day thinking about this kind of stuff. But like my God, I mean, if we could just get everything to be MagSafe and then the opposite end of that be USB-C the world would be so much easier.
So yeah, I hope they go for that. I mean, honestly, I wish they'd get rid of the ports on the iPhones

**Marshall:** Well, yeah.

**Brian** and like have the bottom, it should all just be MagSafe safe. And then, the computers, they should have one, that's a MagSafe one, like sure. I think they should do this for all of them.
I don't know.

**Marshall:** Here's how, okay. Here's how Apple can make a shit ton of money, Brian.

**Brian** *laughs* I mean, they already are, but okay.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Oh, here how they can make a shit ton of more money is, basically you create a proprietary MagSafe connection that works on both your phone and on your computer. That connection can be built into a cable, but it also can be built into an adapter which will plug onto either a lightning or a USB-C. But then the future, you get to a point where it's like, yeah, I just have one cable that goes from USB-C on one end to MagSafe on the other end. I can use that to charge my phone. I could use that to charge my computer. It doesn't really matter. Or I could buy the adapters and just upgrade my existing cables if I don't want to buy new ones. That way my phone has no ports on it, has no openings on it other than like the speaker and microphone, which already have good water protection. And I charg through MagSafe either through the bottom port or on the back of the thing, like that's the world I want to live in. I don't have to plug shit in.

**Brian:** Yep. Maybe uh in 10 years we'll be there. I don't know. But the cable story is frustrating and it's frustrating spending so much money on fucking adapters and accessories and all this kind of stuff, where it's like $30 for cable that should be $2. And I don't know, I think a lot of people are frustrated with Apple about this, but here we are.

**Marshall:** well, maybe let's end with a quick wishlist. Maybe of things we wish were in here.

**Brian:** Yeah, sure. I can start, I was hoping that this year we would get the 120 hertz display on the iPhone Pro

**Marshall:** Yep.

**Brian:** because that has been on the iPad for a little while now. And it is noticeable, and it is good, and I want it everywhere.

**Marshall:** Yep. It's beautiful.

**Brian:** Yeah. So, maybe next year, I don't know. It's just gotta be battery issue, right?


**Marshall:** Uh, no, the rumor was that it was just a supply issue, so, it's slated for next phone.
Okay. So, uh, one thing that I would really like is, you know, in this world where we're wearing masks a good chunk of the time, anytime you're outside of the house, uh, face ID doesn't work. So having that touch ID in the lock button in the same way that the new iPad air has, it would be super cool. Now there's rumors that they're going to have an under the screen fingerprint reader, which I guess would be fine too. I don't know. I feel like that's, maybe that's better for like, purchases and stuff where it's like,

**Brian:** Mm, mm-hmm.

**Marshall:** yeah, I'm confirming a thing or you kind of want it to be on the screen and you don't have to like point at a physical button off screen, but, I don't know, what do you think about that?

**Brian:** Yeah. I mean, if they can get it under the screen, that somehow feels better, but it seems like since they already have the tech to put it in the sleep/wake button on the iPad, like why not just carry that over? I mean, I'm sure there's reasons, but it seems like they could do that and win a lot of brownie points from people who are frustrated with the face ID plus mask combination.

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** If you didn't know, we're a listener supported show, which means that listeners like you make the show possible every week pays for our software, our equipment, and the time it takes to put the show together every week, uh, we're on Patrion at patrion.com/design details. If you go there, you can support us for just a dollar a month.
We wanted to make it really approachable and accessible for everyone. And when you support us, You'll get access to a supporter only segment it's called the sidebar. Uh, it's like a. Basically like half the episode, usually every week, it's like an extra listener question, an extra cool thing, a designed tip or a story, from Marshall Mize sort of day to day work.
today we talked about the latest Apple event. We talked about the home pod, mini iPhone, 12 iPhone 12 pro. We talked about our wishlist. We talked about what MagSafe means for the ecosystem and the weird transition we're in for USB-C, uh, all this stuff and more so if you want some Apple hot takes. That will be more than half of today's episode.
So if you want to hear that plus full episodes of the show going forward, consider supporting us that's at patrion.com/design details.

**Marshall:** Alright, let's do a bit of follow-up here, Brian.

**Brian:** Ookay. Yeah. First follow up tweet comes from Gavin Nelson. Gavin says, how does everyone organize their product design Figma files? I was trying the github approach that Brian talked about on Design Details episode 340. But I hit Figmas two gigabyte file limits. That's a massive-ass file.

**Marshall:** Yep.

**Brian:** My response, I couldn't actually remember what we said in that. I guess that was like six months ago now. But the way we have it working on our very small team at github, uh, the mobile team - very small, so, disclaimer - is we have a file per release generally. And then a page within that file for each feature of their lease. I think that might start changing. We're sort of changing our release process to be fewer big, chunkier releases and more smaller scope, like, individual feature releases. So we might change this to be like a file per feature, which is probably what more people are used to. But when we have like a big, you know, version 1.3 contains these 10 features, we just have a single file for that. iOS mocks go in there, Android mocks go in there. Each have a page per feature where all that work is sort of spread out. And then of course we have like a scrap page where we just dump a bunch of shit.

**Marshall:** Is that additive? So it's everything that you've released in previous releases, plus the stuff from this release.

**Brian:** Nope, just, just the stuff for this release.

**Marshall:** Okay, just the diff.

**Brian:** So that means that over time, your files get out of date. And, you know, if you go back to your 1.1 file, it's going to contain a bunch of stuff that is super old, but I guess that's the nature of working in any way. Like, stuff gets old, it just becomes kind of a nice little archive of the state of the application during that period of time.

**Marshall:** Yeah, this is why as part of our design system, we offer like key screens. So for those major screens that you would want to just drag and drop and then add stuff to. Those are always available, separate from files, as part of like the design system.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yup.

**Marshall:** Cool.  another little piece of followup. So I think this is the final portion of the trilogy of transcripts, Brian. so. We've made the decision. We're going to start making these transcripts available. This will be the first episode where the transcript will be available. Upon release of the episode, it'll be up on our GitHub. I'll paste in a raw version of that, transcript for those of you to edit and make pull requests on and all that stuff. So look for that. We'll have link in the show notes

**Brian:** Yeah, we'll follow up, on people's emails and DMs. So we haven't gotten back to but yeah, so this'll be on github and, uh, still TBD exactly how I'm going to get this on the website, but let's get it on, github for now so that we can start doing it. So if you want to check that out, we'll have a link in the show notes to our repo.

**Marshall:** Cool. Tweets?

**Brian:** Yes, tweets. Alright, we had a tweet this week from Marvin who says: I'm doing a work journal every day for some weeks now it feels so great.

**Marshall:** Yay!

**Brian:** It's a brilliant way to one, document of what you're working on throughout the day, and two, look back at what you've accomplished. Thanks for the recommendations, credits to Marshall Bach.

**Marshall:** Ayy.

**Brian:** That's nice.

**Marshall:** Yup.

**Brian:** Yeah, man. It's so good. Work. Journaling is great. I admit I have missed some days, but, I generally keep it up. I'm hitting like maybe three days a week and sometimes I just forget, or I like having a day where I don't have meetings, which is also a reason for me to miss a day.

**Marshall:** Yeah, you're going to miss days, but you should be missing days because you didn't have anything to write down, rather than you had so much to do that you didn't write down anything. That's the main thing.

**Brian:** Yeah. Yeah. So that's awesome. Glad it's working for you, Marvin.

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** All right. Main topic. This one, let's see where the conversation takes us. So Daniel Burka, friend of the pod tweeted on October 16th says: The current culture of design is weird. And then he has a list of, uh, examples. First I designed an icon with a gradient fill.
Everyone loses their shit. I wrote a book explaining a design process. Polite clapping. We spent three years designing a voting system used by millions, and...

**Brian and Marshall** Crickets.

**Marshall:** Yeah.

**Brian:** And this is true, obviously. Like uh, I think, just look at design Twitter. Watch what gets engagement and what doesn't, and it's basically this. It's like the small, digestible, visual things get lots of attention. The deeper systemic changes at a large organization or a startup that requires like, context, and reading a case study. Not as much attention. You're not going to get that many likes or retweets if that's what your thing is.

**Marshall:** It's not sexy.

**Brian:** And so, yeah. I thought we could just talk about this. Cause I think that part of the culture is weird, but I'm also, I feel like it's not exactly the culture. That's like the culture of social media, which is the small digestible headlines get more attention than the well thought out long form article, right? So it's not design, it's just social media. If there's a picture or a GIF, I can see it in two seconds, digest it, absorb it, like it, or not. Versus seeing a link to a long thing or something that requires me to have background context, I'm more likely to just scroll past it. And I think, you know, it's not great that we exist in that world, but it seems to be sort of the state of social media and the way we consume information. So I don't know, how did this tweet and I guess my followup explanation, how does that strike you?

**Marshall:** Yeah. I mean, this, this feels accurate, especially with the caveat of like, the context of it that you provided. Yeah. I mean, it's a huge bummer man. Like, I feel like it's the same thing that happens elsewhere. It's like the bumper sticker-ization of everything, right?
Like, what is digestible is rewarded and what requires more depth is usually overlooked.

**Brian:** This sort of reminded me of just a problem with, not even tweeting about work, but like even sharing work internally. I think that this exists within an organization. Like if you share a flashy two second prototype that you made an Origami, but it's got a really cool animation and emojis and all this stuff, it seems to get a lot more attention than, you know, an internal case study, or a deck that requires reading and thinking. And so that just made me think that when I'm solving for that problem internally, what's really important is to bring people along for the ride, which means, uh, usually spreading this kind of achievement or work or milestone out over a longer period of time so that people can sort of catch up to where you are with small digestible chunks of information.

So rather than waiting an entire year and then just dropping this big bomb design of like, look at this huge system we made and it solves all these problems, click here to read more and you have to like have paragraphs of background context. Instead, if you can break that up throughout, whatever, this year, and you have smaller ships, you have regular, sort of, context setting moments - I'm balancing like the internal and external hitting here but I think it's all the same - Like how can you just bring people along for the ride so that when the big moments happen, they already have this sort of story playing out in the back of their head about what you've been working on, the thought that's gone into it, the progress of it, they've seen moments of evolution. And I think if you do that, there will be a bigger response. And I know that this is true because you know, the second example that burka mentioned was like, writing a book, explaining a design process, gets polite clapping, but I have seen people publish books that get wild response on social media. And what seems to be true about those moments is the people who wrote those books brought people along through the ride. They tweeted that they were going to write a book, they started tweeting out the titles of chapters, they would share snippets of their work in progress. They would tweet on a Saturday that they're doing editing. They would like add all of these moments up over time, so that when the book comes out, people understand what it took to get there. And they're very excited for that moment. And I think you can be very successful on social media with those big splashes if you've done the work ahead of time.

**Marshall:** Yeah, you get people invested. Yeah. This something I've seen, slightly related, uh, indie game developers on YouTube will put up, you know, weekly or monthly updates, kind of summarizing everything that they've done showing the advancements that they've made. And there are a few games that are in development that I'm actively watching, you know, as they go along, when they come out, I'll buy them. Cause like I'm invested. I'm, I'm here for the development. I feel like I'm part of the process, even though I'm just watching.

**Brian:**  There's something very human about seeing process. Right.

**Marshall:**  Mm-hmm.

**Brian:** And like, When people are transparent about that. That's why I think designers love to see sort of mocks and prototypes, and nerds and developers love to see release notes. It's like we like getting this peek behind the curtain and trying to discern strategy.
And predict what the next move will be and doing all of that. Yeah, it builds people's investment in your work and makes it exciting. People look forward to that next moment. Like, Oh, I wonder what's going to happen next.

**Marshall:**  Mm-hmm.

**Brian:** Becomes like a story. So yeah, I, those are my thoughts on this tweet. And there's of course, a whole other sort of sphere of context here, which is just that I think, you know, on social media, people have very short attention spans and the work does fall on designers to capture that attention if they're trying to tweet something important or talk about some big system, or something that is, I don't know, more in-depth. I'm trying to, I'm lacking the words here, but something that just requires more work to communicate. It's up to the designer to communicate in that in a way that is digestible and understandable, and will catch people where they have a short attention span, but they're sort of pulled in.
And usually I find this happening with people that will have some sort of like provocative opening statement. Then they'll say, you know, thread, colon, and then the rest of the tweets fall into that thread. And that's a way to, to get people to at least have that initial engagement. They tap into the tweet. Now they're viewing the thread. Now, perhaps they're more willing to go through those bite sized chunks and, and get, the bigger picture. Versus trying to capture all of that in like one tweet, it ends up probably sounding a little more marketing speak, or it might be too many characters and people kind of glanc by it.

So I think there's that, like, if you want to have social media impact, you need to design your tweets to account for the way people reward content on social media.

**Marshall:**  Mm-hmm.

**Brian:** And then I guess the last thing that came to mind for me was just the really practical nature. Like I think what Daniel said is frustrating that so much of attention and social media accolades go to the simple visual stuff. But that's also kind of the nature of humans, in my opinion,

**Marshall:**  Mm-hmm.

**Brian:** it's like looking at a GIF or pretty pixels is so much more accessible and visceral and satisfying than an invisible system. Which of course, designers, we want to work on those really cool systems that take a ton of work to put together, that they're beautiful in their architecture, but there's like an invisible-ness to it. Like it's hard to communicate the work that goes into a system versus the work that went into making a gradient look really nice.

**Marshall:** Yeah. Can I, can I draw another parallel here, Brian?

**Brian:** Yeah, yeah. Hit me.

**Marshall:** So, my other thing that I really like is movies. And this is how awards are given out in award season for movies. Like all the actors and directors, they get on the main stage during the show that part gets televised, but like all the screenwriters and sound designers, like, they get their awards on a stage, like in a, in a ballroom, in a hotel, you know, and that's not televised at all. Like nobody hears about that or celebrates it or anything. It's very important for those people, but, like, no one cares about it. Everybody just cares about the pretty actors and the director. Right?

**Brian:** Yeah.

**Marshall:** So not surprising at all. This is kind of how humans work. I agree.

**Brian:** Yeah. Okay. So I guess we can just leave it there. I would say the tweet is true, but there are things that designers can do to counteract it, which we've talked about. And then I think the parallel to like sharing this work externally on Twitter, it mirrors what you have to do internally as well to get people excited in your work.

And so there's a lot to learn from, from reading this. Like how can I make it so that people are excited when I do this big system-y stuff? Well, them along for the ride. I think that's kind of a nice summary.

**Marshall:** Very much agree.

**Brian:** Alright. Wanna do Cool Things?

**Marshall:** Yeah, that was a fun ride Brian. Let's let's do Cool Things. You can go first.

**Brian:** Okay. Uh, my cool thing this week is a YouTube channel. I'm pulling a Marshall here.

**Marshall:** Yeah!

**Brian** Uh, Marshall, I am a fan of the MMORPG genre of video games,

**Marshall:** Uh-huh.

**Brian** computer games. And there is this youtuber who calls himself TheLazyPeon and his channel is just devoted to reviewing and giving first impressions of and sharing gameplay clips of MMORPGs. And I didn't realize how expansive and deep this community goes. Like there's so many games that I've never heard of that have hundreds of thousands or millions of players, which blows my mind. Like, I feel like I'm kind of plugged in to what's popular, but apparently like in these particular niches of gaming I just have no idea what the hell is going on. And so I like this genre, but I obviously don't have time to play every MMORPG. They tend to be big timesinks

**Marshall:** Uh-huh.

**Brian** and you need to put in lots and lots of hours.

**Marshall:** Yes.

**Brian** So this channel has been really nice for me to sort of get the hit of MMORPGs in like a 30 minute review video. And I can just watch him basically montage his way through some levels, and then he gives some pros and cons. And he's like a really dry, sarcastic youtuber,

**Marshall:** Okay.

**Brian** with the way he cuts and edits. So I guess some people might find it boring, but I find it very entertaining and, and he's, he's a funny guy. So, uh, if anyone else who's listening is into MMORPGs, but doesn't have the time to play them. Or I guess if you have the time to play them and you're just looking for a good one, uh, he reviews a lot of them and so, that's TheLazyPeon. Link to the channel will be in the show notes.

**Marshall:** Cool.

**Brian:** All right. Hit me.

**Marshall:** All right. My cool thing this week is an album.

**Brian:** Oh.

**Marshall** Are, are you familiar with Joji, Brian?

**Brian:** No, but I have a clicked on your link in our prep notes, and I've never heard of this... person? Group? Person?

**Marshall:** Okay, so yeah, person. So, so Joji started on YouTube. He had a channel where he had characters, it was basically like super immature, troll-y stuff, but like, uh, he had these characters, like pink guy and filthy Frank. I'm not sure if you've heard of either of those

**Brian:** Nope

**Marshall:** it's like super cringey. Yeah. Don't don't watch it, it's stupid. But, since then he has started to develop a music career. And I think he even made an album as Pink Guy. It was just a bunch of really stupid, like mumble rap songs or something.

**Brian:** *laughs* Okay.

**Marshall:**  But, um, hee released an EP called In Tongues, which was really, really good. And I was super surprised. I, I yknow tangentially knew about him through the pink guy stuff and all that. And like I was aware of his existence, but when he came out with this album, I was like, okay, what's this going to be? And it was really good! And, since then he's come up with some more stuff. He came out with, uh, his first full length album called Ballads One, but his new album is called Nectar and it's very, very, very good, Brian. I've had it on repeat, since it came out a couple of weeks ago, I wanted to like, make sure it was good before I recommend it as a cool thing. It's a real fucking cool thing, Brian. I'm enjoying it very much.

**Brian:** Hell yeah! Alright, alright. I got it. Queued up. I'm downloading it.

**Marshall:** He is actually a very good singer and he flexes his falsetto on this album much more than he has previously. And it's a really good falsetto. Some tracks, just in case you're if you're gonna listen through, I think they're almost all very good. There's a couple that I'm less into, but, the first track you Ew is really good. I love Daylight, and Run is one of my favorite songs on the album. Mr. Hollywood, uh, High Hopes. There's really, really good songs on this album. It's like one of those that you just like, listen straight through and repeat, which is for me, high praise. Cause there's not a whole lot of albums that are that quality that I can listen through without skipping songs.

**Brian:** Yeah, yeah.

**Marshall** So yeah. Nectar by Joji

**Brian:** Awesome. Thank you. Queued it up, I'll listen to it this week.

**Marshall:** Yeah, let me know what you think.

**Marshall* Hasta la vista, Brian!

...

**Marshall* Hasta la vista, Brian!

**Brian** Yeah, I like this. I'm into the theme of butchering foreign languages. I'm wondering if it's gonna make you a lot of enemies. *laughs*

**Marshall:** Hmm. I hadn't considered that angle. I figured it was so obviously bad that it would appear intentional because it is, but, but also we have this stinger to let people know.

**Brian:** All I'm saying is the deep fakes are coming.

**Marshall:** *laughs* Okay.

**Brian:** I'm just kidding. I like it.
